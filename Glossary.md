# Playing the game
# Player
Players have control of a single character and any creatures that player character may control or direct.

# Character
The character is how the player expresses their will and agency in the game. [Blank character](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10aTlE9hAZtmhwTteEyUx-46Uy69LCkR-/view?usp=sharing) sheets are available.

# Game Master
The Game Master facilitates the game, describes the world, controls all other creatures, and is the final arbiter of the rules.

# Creature
Creatures include characters, but the Game Master should avoid controlling characters.

# NPC
Creatures that the Game Master controls. They use [[#Target Numbers]] instead of [[#Rolls]].

# Dice
This game uses dice to add randomness to the outcome of choices.
# D4
This is commonly used for small weapons.
# D6
This is the simple weapon damage die.
# D8
This is the advanced damage die.
# D10
This is the heavy or large weapon damage die.
# D12
This is they die [[#Player|Players]] roll to resolve actions.

# Rolls
When you "make a roll" you roll a [[#d12]] and add a bonus. The bonus is the sum of the [[#Stat]] used for the roll, the [[#SKills|Skill]] being used for the roll, and any [[#Expertise]] that the [[#Game Master]] agrees applies to the roll. Then you compare the total roll to the [[#Target Number]]. 

# Skill Rolls
If you roll 12 on the die you succeed with a [[#Perk]] as long as the total roll is equal to or greater than the Target Number otherwise, it just succeeds. If the total of the die and the bonus is equal to or greater than the [[#Target Number]] the roll succeeds. If the total of the die and bonus is below the [[#Target Number]] you succeed with a [[#Complication]]. If you roll a 1 on the die and the total of the die and the bonus is less than the [[#Target Number]] you fail with a [[#Complication]].

# Attack Rolls
Attacking uses a different scale of success, failure, [[#Perks]], and [[#Complications]]. On a roll of 12 on the die, if and the attack total on is greater or equal to the [[#Target Number]] an attack succeeds with a [[#Perk]], otherwise it just succeeds.  If the total of the die and the bonus is equal to or greater than the [[#Target Number]] the roll succeeds. If the roll total is below the [[#Target Number]] the attack fails. And on a roll of 1 on the die where the total is less than the [[#Target Number]] it fails with a [[#Complication]]. There are standard [[#Perks]] and [[#Complication|Complications]] for combat, but [[#Features]] may provide different ones.

# Attacker Perk
As well as the normal damage dealt, deal the maximum damage possible for the attack’s damage die.

# Attacker Complication
The attacker is [[#Exposed]].

# Defense Rolls
Defending uses the same scale of success as attacking. On a roll of 12 on the die, if and the attack total on is greater or equal to the [[#Target Number]] an attack succeeds with a [[#Perk]], otherwise it just succeeds.  If the total of the die and the bonus is equal to or greater than the [[#Target Number]] the roll succeeds. If the roll total is below the [[#Target Number]] the attack fails. And on a roll of 1 on the die where the total is less than the [[#Target Number]] it fails with a [[#Complication]]. There are standard [[#Perks]] and [[#Complication|Complications]] for combat, but [[#Features]] may provide different ones.

# Defender Perk
The attacker is [[#Exposed]].

# Defender Complication
The character takes double damage from the attack instead of the normal damage.

# Target Number
The Target Number is what the player needs to roll for success. 


# Edge
When a character has Edge they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the highest roll. If an [[#NPC]] has a [[#Hindrance]] on a defense the attacking character has an [[#Edge]] on all rolls against that defense.

# Hindrance
When a character has a [[#Hindrance]] they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the lowest roll. If an [[#NPC]] has [[#Edge]] on an attack or skill the character has a [[#Hindrance]] when rolling their defense.

# Automatic Success
If a creature has proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] or an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed all [[#Simple]] rolls. If they have both proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] and an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed on [[#Easy]] rolls.  

# Bennies
As a [[#Response]] a character can spend bennies to reroll a [[#d12]]. They can have a maximum of three Bennies at any time. At the beginning of a session the character starts with two. You gain bennies by expressing your character's [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]] in play. As well, [[#Game Master|Game Masters]] and [[#Player|Players]] (with [[#Game Master]] approval) can give bennies to another [[#Player]] for exceptional roleplay.  

# Rolling as a NPC
The [[#Game Master]] never rolls a [[#d12]], so when an NPC would need to roll add 5 to the applicable bonuses and that becomes the [[#Target Number]] the defender has to overcome.

# Rolling Other Dice 
If a different die is required other than the [[#d12]] the die will be noted. This is most often done when rolling damage. There may be a bonus that is applied to this one roll and the applicable [[#Stat]] will be noted. 

# Features
Features grant new capabilities to characters. They come from the character's [[#Ancestry]], [[#Archetype]], and [[#Culture]]. Some will apply in specific situations, others will give you new opportunities to roll, and most will provide new actions for your character to make.


# Personality Traits
By playing your character's personality traits, the [[#Game Master]] rewards [[#Bennies]] that can be spent later. If you want to highlight you are playing a trait make an aside comment that you are playing to your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]]. 

# Drive
What drives your [[#Character]]? Why do they adventure? Why didn't they just take the same job as a parent and stay near their home? They should be active goals that are not permanently achievable but can be acted on in the moment.

- To protect those who cannot protect themselves.
- To break the bonds of tyranny.
- To live free and experience the world.
- To repay a debt I can never repay.
- To seek wealth and the pleasures it brings.

# Bond
What ideals does your [[#Character]] follow in everyday life? What does your character hew to? This should be something that informs how they react to their own plight and the plight of those around in the face of adversity.

- Faith provides
- Those I meet are friends until proven otherwise
- Knowledge must be preserved above all else.
- I am loyal to those who share my desire to do great deeds

# Flaw
What undermines your character? Is this your [[#Character|Character's]] drive taken to extreme? Is it an exception that will have you set aside your bond? Is it a weakness that your [[#Character]] will revert to when pressed? Acting on the [[#Character|Character's]] Flaw is the easiest to gain [[#Bennies]]. As well, overcoming the flaw at great cost to your character is worth gaining [[#Bennies]]. 

- I am a braggart that will bite off more than I can chew.
- I care more about enriching myself than the lives of others.
- In the face of overwhelming odds I will abandon my fellows.
- The pursuit of knowledge blinds me to the plight of others.

# Ancestry
What fantastical bloodline does your character come from? What Ancestry [[#Features|Feature]] does that bloodline bestow? A full-blooded character gains both Ancestry [[#Features]]. A half-blooded character chooses one [[#Features|Feature]] from each parent's ancestry.

# Culture
A character's culture provides a base of experience, as well it forms a broad [[#Expertise]]. Characters can use their culture as a generalized [[#Expertise]] if the situation calls for it. As well, each culture can bestow a specific [[#Features|Feature]] or [[#Expertise]]. 

# Background
What did your character do before they became an adventurer?  This also can be used as an expertise when it could apply to the roll. Backgrounds are also broad [[#Expertise|Expertises]] that encompass many aspects of coming from that Background. Some backgrounds may also grant specific an [[#Expertise]].

# Archetype
The character Archetype is the primary source of Character [[#Features]]. As well they inform how the character will be optimally played.

# React
[[#Dexterity]] and [[#Wits]] combine to make up a creature's React defense. This is used to avoid attacks or other hazards.

# Mind
[[#Aptitude]] and [[#Will]] combine to make up a creature's Mind defense. This is used to resist attempts to bend their will, confuse them, or otherwise attack the creatures psyche.

# Deflect
A character's Deflect is their [[#React]] defense plus any [[#Deflection]] modifier provided by the armor or shield they are wearing.

# Soak Bonus
This bonus adds to the character's [[#Body]] to derive the character's [[#Soak]].


# Tags

# Ammunition
Weapon uses ammunition that is tracked separately and may replace the damage dealt by the weapon. Ammunition breaks on misses and cannot be recovered.

# Bladed
Deals damage by cutting a target.

# Blunt
Blunt weapons rely on impact to do damage. The wielder may choose to do non-lethal damage when they hit. If the attack would drop the target to 0 [[#HP]] or below, they have 1 [[#HP]] and are [[#Unconscious]]. 

# Charging
If the wielder moves at least half their speed before striking, deal an additional die of damage.

# Disarming
On a hit if the attack roll also exceeds the target's [[#Body]] defense the attacker can choose to remove an item being held by the target instead of damage.

# Two-Handed
Requires two hands to wield.

# Versatile
Can be wielded [[#Two-Handed]] or single-handed in melee. When wielded [[#Two-Handed]] it uses the  Versatile die to deal damage instead of normal damage.

# Difficulty
Once you decide a roll is necessary you need to set the difficulty. The difficulty should be tailored to the task at hand, not the Tier of the characters. While higher Tier characters will have increased bonuses from [[#Skills]] and [[#Expertise|Expertises]] the difficulty should stay the same based on the challenge of the task regardless of Tier. However, the difficulty should not change based on the potential consequences of a roll. Just because jumping over a fissure is Easy, but depending on the depth the consequences of failure can still be dire.

| Difficulty | [[#Target Number]] | [[#Difficulty Modifier]] |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Simple | 4 | -2 |
| Easy | 6 | +0 |
| Moderate | 10 | +4 |
| Hard | 14 | +8 |
| Improbable | 18 | +12 |
| Impossible | 24 | +16 |

# Simple
Anyone with a passing familiarity with the task can achieve it. The [[#Target Number]] is 4, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is -2.

# Easy
Anyone trained in the task can successfully achieve it. The [[#Target Number]] is 4, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is +0.

# Moderate
This takes some effort to achieve, but can be achieved with time and focus. The [[#Target Number]] is 10, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is +4.

# Hard
Even with time and focus it requires a steady hand, extensive training, or luck. The [[#Target Number]] is 14, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is +8.

# Improbable
Only those with mastery of a task can push themselves this far to hope to achieve this level of outcome. The [[#Target Number]] is 18, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is +12.

# Impossible
This is the realm of gods and immortals. Only the highest tier characters can hope to succeed at these tasks. The [[#Target Number]] is 24, and the [[#Difficulty Modifier]] is +16.

# Difficulty Modifier
Sometimes the Target Number is already set and how the players want to approach the problem changes the difficulty. For example, they want to convince an NPC to help them. That would be an Easy [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] roll against the target’s [[#Mind]] defense, except as part of their request they have insulted something the NPC holds dear and now the NPC dislikes them. Now the task has become [[#Moderate]], so the [[#Game Master]] adds a +4 to the [[#Target Number]]. Or the characters included a bribe in their request, now the request becomes [[#Simple]] changing the [[#Target Number]] by -2.

# Perk
Perks are additional benefits beyond succeeding at a task. This could be revealing a new resource, providing a new opportunity or other thing that will not just progress the story but allow the character to leap forward.

# Complication
Complications are new problems that arise when a character attempts a task. They could be a change to the scene, the addition of a new foe, a change in the tenor of an interaction, or other new problems for the players to solve.

# Complex Roll
Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single Stat+Skill check. In this case, the Game Master decides on three Stat+Skill rolls necessary to complete the task. Some of the available Stat+Skill rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest adding an [[#Expertise]] that might apply, but it is up to the Game Master to allow it. Three different characters need to complete each of the three checks. Depending on how many checks succeed, determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, in addition to what s [[#Perks]] or [[#Complications]] there may be.

- **Three Successes** - succeed with a Perk.
- **Two Successes** - succeed in the task.
- **One Success** - success with a [[#Complication]]
- **No Successes** - failing with a [[#Complication]] the task

A single character can make more than one roll, but they gain a [[#Hindrance]] for every roll beyond the 1st. A character can assist another character who is rolling, granting the rolling character an [[#Edge]] on their roll.

# Initiative
When combat initiates the GM rolls the [[#d20]]. If the roll is 10 or higher the characters take their [[#Turn]] first. If it is less than 10, the enemy takes their [[#Turn]] first. Once both sides have taken their [[#Turn|Turns]] the [[#Lair Acts]] and [[#Environmental Events]] happen.

# Turn
During their side’s turn each creature can move, make one [[#Act]], make one [[#Swift Act]], and make one [[#Minor Action]]. They can take them at any time during their side’s turn in any order. Players are encouraged to coordinate their actions. They are playing professional combatants and can behave accordingly.

# Round
Once each side has taken a turn, any [[#Lair Acts]] or [[#Environmental Effects]] happen at this time. The total time elapsed is 6 seconds per round.

# Spaces
Spaces are an abstraction of space for the creatures to move through. This assumes that play takes place on a battle map with a grid of some sort. If you are not using a battle mat see [[#Theater of the Mind]] on how to work with spaces. They are either 1 space or 2 meters depending on your Game Master’s preference. [[#Tiny]] creatures exist in a space, but do not take up a space. [[#Small]] and [[#Medium]] creatures take up a single Space. This both includes the area they fill but also the area needed to [[#Act]] freely. [[#Large]] creatures take up a two-by-two square of spaces. [[#Huge]] creatures take up a three-by-three square of spaces. [[#Gargantuan]] take up more spaces than can easily be represented on a battlefield. They are treated as an aspect of the terrain and are immune to being moved against their will.

# Move Through
A creature can move through an allied creature's space. When moving through an enemy’s space, the area is considered Difficult Terrain. If a creature ends their turn within another creature's space they are [[#Sharing a Space]] if they are allied, and [[#Squeeze]] if they are enemies.

# Share a Space
Two allied creatures can share the same space. While they are in the same space both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#Athletics]], [[#Enigma]], and [[#Weapon]] rolls. As well, both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#React]] and [[#Deflect]] defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Squeeze
To opposing creatures can squeeze into a space. While they share a space they both have a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#Athletics]], [[#Enigma]], and [[#Weapon]] rolls, except for Weapon rolls with weapons with the [[#Fine]] [[#Tags|Tag]]. As well, both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#React]] and [[#Deflect]] defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Adjacent
Creatures who's occupied space touches another creature’s occupied space are considered Adjacent.

# Threatened Spaces
The spaces that a creature can reach with a wielded weapon are considered threatened. Moving out of a threatened space will provoke a Movement Response unless the creature makes an Evade Act.

# Expose
Exposing a target makes them vulnerable to attacks that [[#Exploit]]. Some conditions Expose a creature to specific attackers. 

# Flanking
When allied creatures are opposite of each other with the target in the middle, the target is exposed to their flanking attackers.

# Exploit
Some abilities require a target to be exposed to exploit. 

# Act
Acts are the primary actions made in combat. They do the most, hit the hardest, or have the most spectacular effects.


# Swift Act
Swift Acts are actions that follow the main action. They could be offhand attacks, abilities, or other actions that don't rise to a full [[#Act]].

# Move Act
[[#Creatures]] can move up to their total speed in one round. That movement can be interspersed with other actions as long as the total movement is no more than their movement speed.

# Minor Act
Minor Acts are saying a few words, interacting with an object, drawing a weapon, dropping an item in the creature's hand, handing off an item to another willing creature, or other simple activity that doesn't require attention while distracted by combat.

# Response
Creatures respond to another creature's action during the other side's turn. A creature has a single response they can take before their next turn unless otherwise specified.

# Movement Response 
When a creature moves out of a [[#Threatened Space]] without making a [[#withdraw]] act, the creature threatening that space can make an melee weapon attack on that creature.

# Defending
When a Character is attacked or otherwise the target of a spell or ability, the [[#Player]] rolls a [[#d12]] and adds the appropriate [[#Defense]] bonus against a [[#Target Number]] set by the attack.

# Damage Resistance
If a creature has Damage Resistance they take half damage, rounded down, before applying their [[#Soak]].

# Massive Damage
If a creature takes more than half of their [[#Maximum HP]] in a single attack they need to make a [[#Body]] roll against the total damage taken. If they fail, they drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]]. Creatures that take more than their [[#Maximum HP]] before applying [[#Soak]] drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]].

# Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[#HP]] they fall [[#Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

# Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[#Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, and on a [[#Critical Success]] they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and on a [[#Critical Failure]] they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[#HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[#HP]] stabilizes the creature. Another creature can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical Expertise to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[#Temporary [[#HP]]]] while having 0 [[#HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.

# Conditions
Conditions are temporary effects that change a creature's capabilities. The source of the condition will have rules on how the condition ends. And there are abilities and spells that can end conditions immediately.

# Blinded
The character cannot see and as such have Hindrance on [[#React]] rolls, [[#Deflect]] rolls and [[#Senses]] rolls. Characters have an [[#Edge]] on attack rolls against creatures who are Blinded. Attacks made by a Blinded creatures have a [[#Hindrance]]. [[#Stealth]] rolls have [[#Edge]] against Blinded creatures. Blind creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Bleeding
The creature loses one [[#HP]] at the start of their turn until they are healed at least 1 [[#HP]] or as an [[#Act]] a creature makes an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[#Expertise]]) with a [[#Target number]] of 8.

# Charmed
The charmed creature cannot attack the creature that charmed it. The charmed creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on rolls that use [[#Will]] or their [[#Mind]] defense when interacting with the creature that charmed it. Charmed creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]] to the creature that charmed it.

# Deafened
The character cannot hear and as such as a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#React]] rolls, [[#Social]] rolls, and [[#Senses]] rolls. [[#Stealth]] rolls have [[#Edge]] against deafened creatures. Deafened creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Frightened
The creature cannot move towards the source of their fear. Frightened characters have a [[#Hindrance]] on all rolls while they can sense the source of their fear. Characters that inspire fear have an [[#Edge]] on rolls targeting their [[#Mind]] defense. Frightened creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Grappled
The grappled creature's speed is reduced to 0 and attacks with weapons that don't have the [[#Fine]] [[#Tags|Tag]] have a [[#Hindrance]]. Grappled creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Incapacitated
The creature cannot [[#Act]], make a [[#Swift Act]], make a [[#Response]], or move. Incapacitated  creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Paralyzed
A creature is [[#Incapacitated]] and cannot speak. They automatically fail [[#React]] defenses. Melee attacks against the paralyzed creature are a [[#Critical Success]]. Paralyzed creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Petrified
Petrified creatures and their held items are changed to an inanimate substance. They are [[#Paralyzed]], have [[#Damage Resistance]], and are immune to poison, disease, and aging. Poisons and diseases are not neutralized, just suspended. Petrified  creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Prone
Prone creatures can only crawl using two spaces of movement for every space traveled. Standing up spends half their movement speed. The prone creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on attack rolls. Melee attacks against the prone creature have an [[#Edge]]. Prone creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]] to melee attacks.

# Restrained
Restrained creatures total speed becomes 0. The restrained creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on their [[#React]] defense. The restrained creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on all attacks. Restrained creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# Sickened
Sickened creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on all [[#d12]] rolls.

# Unconscious
Unconscious creatures are [[#Paralyzed]] and [[#Prone]]. Unconscious creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

# The Scene

The scene encompasses the area the action takes place in, the [[#Features]] of that area, the creatures within the area, and the actions they take.

# Scene Features
Every scene should have Scene Features in it that the [[#Character|Characters]] and [[#NPC|NPCs]] can interact with. The action should not take place in a featureless void. Chairs that can be thrown at a foe to [[#Expose]] them, tables to flip and provide cover, campfires that can be kicked to spread fire, and chandeliers to swing from are Scene Features that the [[#Game Master]] can populate the scene with. Interacting with Scene Features should generally be a [[#Swift Act]] or a [[#Minor Act]].

# Environmental Events
At the end of the [[#Round]], Environmental Events trigger. They may be traps going off, an environmental hazard happens like a landslide, steam burst, or other hazardous event. They have a [[#Target Number]] to avoid. Some times succeeding on the defense roll against Environmental Events may still do damage on a successful defense roll. 

# Cover
If a creature has at least half of their body behind something solid at opaque between them and their attacker they are considered under Cover. Obscuring effects, like dim light, fog, or dense foliage can also provide Cover from creatures more than 1 space away.  Character's have [[#Edge]] on [[#React]] defenses when behind cover, and have [[#Hindrance]] on attacks against creatures who have cover.

# Full Cover
If a creature is fully obscured from the vision of their attacker either behind something solid and opaque or within darkness they have Full Cover. Attackers still know the creature is there unless the creature becomes [[#Hidden]].

# Hidden
A creature is hidden if they have moved into full cover and succeeded on [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creature then moved at least half their movement. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position will not be noticed until the beginning the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell. Creatures that do not see a hidden creature are [[#Expose|Exposed]] to the hidden creature.

# Invisible
A creature is invisible if they cannot be seen, either by a spell, ability, or in complete darkness. A creature can estimate where an invisible target is with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll using senses other than sight against the target's [[#React]]. If the target is moving stealthily they can make an opposing [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll.

Even if the target is located, all attempts to hit the creature have [[#Hindrance]]. Spells do not have line of effect, so the creature cannot be targeted by non-area spells.

# Light
Each light source casts an aura of bright light of a specific radius and an aura of dim light twice the radius. 

# Daylight
Daylight is natural light from the sun. Its dim light is still considered daylight.

# Bright Light
Bright light is easy to see in and confers no cover to creatures within it.

# Dim Light
Dim Light is difficult to see in. Targets in dim light are within [[#Cover]].

# Darkness
Creatures in darkness are effectively [[#Invisible]].

# Difficult Terrain
Moving through one space of Difficult Terrain requires two spaces of movement.

# Hazardous Terrain
Hazardous terrain is [[#Difficult Terrain]] that also deals damage when a character begins their turn within the area or and they move through the area. Steam vents, vicious brambles, or spinning blades are all Hazardous Terrain. The Hazardous Terrain may have a [[#Target Number]] to avoid the damage with your React defense.

# Aquatic Terrain
# Swimming
Unless a creature has a swim speed they move at half speed. In armor they need to make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll with a [[#Target Number]] of 6 + the armor and shield's [[#Deflection Bonus]]  every round or begin to sink.

# Holding Breath
A creature makes a [[#Swift Act]] to hold their breath by making a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll, they can hold it for as many rounds as a the roll. If a creature takes damage while holding their breath a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll against the damage taken is required. If the creature fails they begin suffocating.

# Suffocating
A creature can suffocate for a number of rounds equal to their [[#Body]] defense. After that they begin making [[#Stabilization Roll]]s at the beginning of their turn as long as it is in the water.

# Durability
Objects have durability. It is a score that is applied to damage before soak and it can reduce the damage to 0. The score is set by the [[#Difficulty]] of damaging the object. So [[#Hard]] to damage items have a Durability of 14, [[#Easy]] to break items have a Durability of 6. Unless they are built to resist damage they have a [[#Soak]] of 0 an [[#Hp]] of 1. Dealing enough damage to surpass the target’s Durability always adds a [[#Complication]].

# Mounts
Mounts, by default, attempt to use their action to [[#Dodge]] if they don't move, or [[#Evade]] if they do. Commanding a mount to do anything else requires a [[#Swift Act]]. If the commanded [[#Act]] is [[#Easy]] such as moving, attacking if battle trained, or dodging the commanding the Act does not require a roll to command. But if the [[#Act]] is more complex or requires the mount to make a roll, like jumping a gap, using a terrain feature, or other action then the rider must make a [[#Will]]+[[#Pilot]] roll. The [[#Target Number]] of the command is the same as the [[#Target Number]] for the commanded [[#Act]]. The rider rolls for their mount.

# Vehicles
Vehicles, like creatures, have the seven [[#Stats]]: [[#Strength]], [[#Fortitude]], [[#Dexterity]], [[#Deflect]], [[#Durability]], [[#Soak]], and [[#Maximum HP]], but no mental [[#Stats]] so cannot act on their own (unless they are sentient) and must be commanded by a creature making a [[#Swift Act]]. If the vehicle is moving it does not require a command to maintain speed and direction. Commanding a vehicle requires a [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]] roll with the [[#Target Number]] set by the [[#Difficulty]] of the [[#Act]].

Weapons built into the vehicle have the [[#Emplaced]] tag and require an [[#Act]] to operate. If they also have the [[#Mechanical]] [[#Tags|Tag]] they require a [[#Swift Act]] to reload.

# Accelerate
Accelerate allows the participant to increase speed. That increase maxes out at twice the movement speed of the participant. At every space beyond their base speed they accelerate, the [[#Target Number]] for their [[#Pilot]] rolls increase by 1. As well, the damage that a complication can do increases by 1 die for every four spaces of increased speed.

# Disappear
When traveling through terrain that can screen the participant they try and use the terrain to [[#Hide]] from their pursuers. The [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]] roll is against the pursuer’s [[#Mind]]. It costs the participant at least half of their current speed, if not all. If passengers roll against the pursuers they become aware of the disappeared participant.

# Elude
Eluding gives the participant an [[#Edge]] on [[#Deflect]] rolls. All [[#Skill]] and [[#Attack Rolls]] by passengers have a [[#Hinderance]].

# Hold Steady
The pilot takes no act but directing the mount's or vehicle's movement. If passing through Difficult Terrain they must make a [[#Pilot]]+[[#Wits]] roll to maintain their speed and avoid any potential [[#Terrain Hazards]].

# Juke
The pilot attempts to direct another chase participant into a Terrain Hazard. All [[#Skill]] and [[#Attack Rolls]] rolls by passengers have a [[#Hinderance]].

# Swap
The pilot attempts to get behind a participant that is behind them. They must make a [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]] roll against the target’s [[#Mind]] defense. If they succed they can slow their speed and change their distance from each other based on how much of a change they made. All [[#Skill]] rolls by passengers have a [[#Hinderance]].

# Terrain Hazards
When in a chase, Terrain Hazards are things that interfere with the chase. As part of the pilot’s [[#Move Act]], the pilot must make a [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]] roll grater than the terrain’s difficulty. They add complications on a failed roll.

- **Crowds** - Non-participants that are in the way to that will stop the participant at slow speeds or will take damage at high speeds. 
- **Buildings** - Tight corridors or buildings make for navigational hazards. Typically failing a [[#Pilot]] roll will stop a participant and they will take damage.
- **Debris** - There are debris on the participants path that will do damage to the participants or their vehicles.

# Chase Complications
- **Glancing Blow** - The participant hits a hazard but doesn’t slow. Participant takes 1d6 damage for every 4 spaces of speed beyond 6 that they were traveling at.
- **Impact** - Depending on the speed of the chase the participant impacts an object. Typically only happens on a failed [[#Pilot]] roll. Participant comes to a stop and takes 1d6 damage for every 2 spaces of speed beyond 6 they were traveling at.
- **Rattled** - The participant has a [[#Hinderance]] on their next [[#Turn]].
- **Slowed** - The participant moves back along the line half their current speed.

# Chase Perks
- **Shortcut** - The participant additionally moves their speed. This doesn't increase their speed but does change their distance from other participants.
- **Interference** - If the participant is ahead of another, they use the environment to increase lead a pursuer into [[#Difficult Terrain]] or [[#Hazardous Terrain]].
- **Lock On** - If the participant is behind another, they have advantage on [[#Acts]] that target the other participant.

# Theater of the Mind
The previous rules assume that you will use a battle mat with standardized spaces. But if you are not then it is easier to use Theater of the Mind to manage combat. In Theater of the Mind, each side has four zones where the combatants are placed.

Not all scenes will have all zones. Large rooms, galleries, back alleys, and other enclosed areas may only have the [[#Adjacent Zone]], [[#Close Zone]], and [[#Mid Zone]] to be positioned in. Hallways, small rooms, and other tight areas may only have the [[#Adjacent Zone]] and [[#Close Zone]].

[[#Thrown]] or [[#Ranged]] weapons can hit one additional zone beyond their range, but at a [[#Hindrance]].

# Adjacent Zone 
Can use melee attacks against opponents. Using [[#Ranged]] attacks or [[#Throwing]] a weapon from this zone has a [[#Hindrance]]. Moving out of this zone, or attacking a different creature that still is in the Adjacent Zone, provokes a [[#Movement Response]] unless the creature makes an [[#Evade]] [[#Act]]. 

# Close Zone 
Attacks that have [[#Reach]] or are [[#Ranged]] to target creatures in the opposing Adjacent zone from the Close Zone. Attacks with a range of 6 spaces or less can hit the opposing Close Zone. And Attacks with a range of 12 or less can hit the opposing Mid Zone.

# Mid Zone
Attacks that have a range below 12 spaces can hit the opposing Adjacent Zone and Close Zone. Attacks with a range greater than 12 can hit the opposing Mid Zone

# Far Zone
Attacks with a range greater or equal to 12 can hit the opposing Adjacent Zone, Close Zone, and Mid Zone. 

# Travel Time
Travel time is the distance that can be traveled on foot in a set time. This includes stopping for rest breaks and not pushing beyond Easy exertion. The time can be cut in a quarter by every creature making a [[#Moderate]] [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Athletics]] roll. Failure of this roll decreases the creature’s [[#Body]] by 1. At -4 the creature falls unconscious. Recovering this [[#Body]] damage requires a day without traveling and lacking exertions like combat. 

# Navigating
When navigating between two distant points the party needs to make a [[#Complex Tasks|Complex Task]] with a [[#Target Number]] based on the ease of finding their way efficiently once per long rest. Well-traveled roads are Simple to follow. Trails and side roads are Easy to travel. And moving through terrain without guideposts or developed paths are Difficult.  

The party navigates with a [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll, detect danger with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll, and to maintain speed with a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the [[#Target Number]] to arrive in the expected amount of time. As a [[#Perk]] they either arrive early or have a beneficial encounter as they travel. As a Complication they have a hostile encounter. On failure they get [[#Lost]] and can attempt to navigate again the next day.

# Lost
Characters who are lost need to make an [[#Easy]] [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to orient themselves. On a success they find their way, as a [[#Perk]] they are actually closer to their destination than they expected. As a [[#Complication]] they have an encounter, and on a failure they spend a day and remain Lost.

# Long Rest
Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain their [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[#HP]]. Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour.  Doing actions that take place during a [[#Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.

# Short Rest
Short Rests are an hour of relaxation. Some [[#Features]] and [[#Magic Items]] reset on a Short Rest.

# Coin
Coin is the simplest form of reward, but it is also the least effective. Other than providing a more comfortable lifestyle for the character, are not many outlets for Coin unless the [[#Game Master]] provides opportunities for spending it. Estates, Hirelings, mission-specific equipment, and other things are opportunities for spending Coin that the [[#Game Master]] can provide.

# Magic Items
Magic items are the easiest way to provide characters new [[#Features]]. It is not advised that the characters can just buy magic items in shops. But, being rewarded with information on where the items they desire can be located, quest givers who will give the item in exchange for a job, or master crafters who could build the desired consumable item are all good avenues for getting characters items their [[#Player]] wants.

# Boons
Boons are supernatural rewards that gives the character an [[#Edge]] in a specific situation. This could be when negotiating with the Fae, or when fighting a certain [[#NPC]], or when attempting a specific task. They should be of limited scope but come up with some regularity.

# Expertise Rewards
[[#Expertise|Expertises]] given as a reward should be of very limited scope and reflect the adventure in which they earned. They could be [[#Expertise]] in the traps they overcame, the architecture of the scenes, the history of the area, or other aspect of the adventure.

# Social Rewards
Titles and appellations are always good rewards. As the [[#Character|Characters]] become known they can gain titles that can give them an [[#Edge]] in certain situations. They do a great service to a noble and become “Errants”, they now have an [[#Edge]] when dealing in that noble’s court. They pull off a job for the thieves guild, they become “Crows” and get better deals when they hock their treasures.

# Advancing the Character’s Drive
Finally, the opportunity to express the character’s drive and advance it. This is the hardest to achieve, but it is the one that tends to engage the players the most.

# Enchanted Items
Enchanted Items are treasure that add [[#Features]] to a creature that wields, wears, or holds it.

# Enchanted Ammunition
Enchanted Ammunition breaks and cannot be recovered when expended. Thrown weapons can be enchanted as ammunition and will not break on misses.

# Armor
Any type of armor can be enchanted. 

# Artifact
Artifacts are powerful items that have multiple aspects.

# Consumable
Consumable items can be used once and then they are destroyed.

# Legacy
Legacy items have [[#Features|Feature]] based on the Tier of the wielder. Legacy items must be [[#Attuned]] to use. When gaining a new [[#Features|Feature]], it does not replace a previous [[#Features|Feature]] unless it has the same name. With the unlock of each new [[#Features|Feature]] the item needs to be re-identified at the new Tier to determine how to activate the new [[#Features|Feature]]. Most Legacy items have a base form, this can be broad encompassing a wide range of forms, or specific limiting their enchantment to a single form.

# Recharge
Some items' abilities have a limited amount of uses between Long Rests.

# Weapon
Unless otherwise noted in the description, the weapon can take any form.

# Size
How much space does a creature take up.

# Tiny
Tiny creatures threaten the space they are in. Creatures can [[#Move Through]] without it being [[#Difficult Terrain]], have to [[#Squeeze]], or [[#Share a Space]].

# Small
Small creatures occupy a 1 space and threaten creatures within adjacent spaces. They can [[#Move Through]] an occupied square without it being [[#Difficult Terrain]].

# Medium
Medium creatures occupy a 1 space and threaten creatures within adjacent spaces. If their attack has a longer [[#Reach]] it will be noted and [[#Threatened Space|Threaten]] creatures within that area.

# Large
Large creatures occupy a 2 spaces square and [[#Threatened Space|Threaten]] creatures within 2 spaces. If their attack has a longer [[#Reach]] it will be noted and [[#Threatened Space|Threaten]] creatures within that area.

# Huge
Huge creatures occupy a 4 spaces square and [[#Threatened Space|Threaten]] creatures within 3 spaces. If their attack has a longer [[#Reach]] it will be noted and [[#Threatened Space|Threaten]] creatures within that area.

# Challenge
The challenge rating is a score of relative difficulty of the creature. It is a determined by a combination of Defenses, [[#HP]], and Attacks per round.

# Stats and Target Numbers

These are the Creature's [[#Stats]], they are only used for calculating a [[#Target Number]] and are never rolled. To derive a [[#Target Number]] add 5 to the total bonus.

# Defenses
Creatures don't roll Defenses, they have a set [[#Target Number]].

# Speed
The speed to move on the ground.

# Fly
The creature must move at least half their move every round. They can only move upward half their total move. If the creature is knocked [[#Prone]] they begin falling.

# Swim
The creature can move this speed through water and typically can breath in water.

# Climb
Can move up and down vertical surfaces without a penalty to movement.


# Condition Immunities
The creature cannot have the listed condition.

# Abilities
