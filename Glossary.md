# Character
The character is how the player expresses their will and agency in the game. 

# Game Master
The Game Master facilitates the game, describes the world, controls all other creatures, and is the final arbiter the rules.

This game uses dice to add randomness to the outcome of choices.
# D4
This is commonly used for [[#Fine]] weapons and bonus die added to rolls.
# D6
This is the common damage die.
# D8
This is the advanced damage die.
# D10
This is the heavy damage die.
# D12
This is what you roll to resolve actions.

# Target Number
The target number is what the player needs to roll for success. Here are some sample target numbers to match the difficulty of the task.

# Difficulty

| Difficulty | Target Number |
|:--:|:--:|
| Simple | 4 |
| Easy | 6 |
| Difficult | 10 |
| Hard | 12 |
| Deadly | 16 |
|Impossible|24|

# Edge
When a character has Advantage they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the highest roll. If a creature has disadvantage on a defense the attacking character has Advantage on all rolls against that defense.

# Hinderance
When a character has disadvantage they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the lowest roll. If a creature has advantage on an attack or skill the target creature has Disadvantage when rolling their defense against it.

# Automatic Success
If you have proficiency in a skill you automatically succeed all Simple rolls. If you also have applicable [[#Specialty]] you automatically succeed at Easy rolls.  

# Bennies
As a [[#Response]] you can spend bennies to reroll a d12. You can have as many bennies as your [[#Proficiency Bonus]]. You gain bennies by expressing your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]] in play. As well, [[#Game Master|Game Masters]] and [[#Player|Players]] (with [[#Game Master]] approval) can give out bennies to a [[#Player]] for exceptional roleplay.  

# Rolling Other Dice

# Complex Task
Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] check. In this case the [[#Game Master]] decides on three [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls necessary to compete the task. Some of the available [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest [[#Specialties]] that might apply, but it is up to the [[#Game Master]] to allow it. Three different characters need to complete one of the three checks. Depending on how many succeed determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, as we as if it has bonuses or complications.

* **Two Successes** - succeed in the task.
* **One success** - success with a [[#Complication]]

# Turn
On each creature's initiative they can make one [[#Act]], one [[#Bonus Action]], and a [[#Minor Action]].

# Expose
Exposing a target makes them vulnerable to exploiting. Some conditions expose a creature to specific attacks. 

# Flanking
When allied creatures are opposite of each other with the target in the middle, the target is exposed to melee attacks.

# Exploit
Some abilities require a target to be exposed to exploit. 

# Act
Acts are the primary actions made in combat. They do the most, hit the hardest, or have the most spectacular effects.

# Attack
You make a [[#Weapons]]+[[#Stats|Stat]] (as appropriate for that weapon) roll against a target's [[#React]] defense. If you roll over the [[#React]] defense the attack connects and you deal damage according to the weapon's features. Some weapons have features that can be used instead of making an attack. Using those features is treated like an attack.

# Cast a spell
To cast a spell you roll Enigmas + Stat (Casting stat for your class) against the target's defense as listed in the spell. If you cast a spell of level 1 or higher you can no longer cast a spell as a bonus action.

# Dash
You can move up to your speed.

# Dodge
You have advantage on all [[#React]] rolls until your next turn.

# Grab
You make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll to give the target creature the [[#grappled]] condition. A creature can roll their [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] or [[#Strength]]+[[#Dexterity]] against the grabbing creature's [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] to escape the grab.

# Help
While adjacent to a foe threatened by an ally, you can help that ally hit easier. You grant that ally [[#Advantage]] on their next attack and [[#Expose]] the enemy until the beginning of your next turn.

# Hide

The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position not be noticed until the beginning of the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell.

# Shove
You make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against the target's [[#Body]] to push the target and knock them prone.

# Withdraw

If you have a weapon with the [[#Fine]] feature it can be used to make an offhand attack.

# Cast a Spell
If you cast a spell with a [[#Bonus Action]] casting time, you cannot cast another spell this round, other than a cantrip.

# Minor Action
Minor actions are saying a few words, interacting with an object, drawing a weapon, dropping an item in your hand, hand off an item to another willing creature, or other simple activity that doesn't require attention while distracted by combat.

# Response
Response actions are done in response to another creature's action during their turn. A creature has a single response they can take between their turns unless otherwise specified.

# Damage Resistance
If you have resistance you take half damage before applying soak.

# Massive Damage

# Temporary HP
Temporary HPs are additional beyond the character's [[#HP]]. When a character gains Temporary HPs they replace the current value if the current value is higher. When the character takes damage the Temporary HPs go after soak before [[#HP]].

# Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[#HP]] they fall [[#Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

# Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[#Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, and on a [[#Critical Success]] they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and on a [[#Critical Failure]] they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[#HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[#HP]] stabilizes the creature. Another creature can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical specialty to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[#Temporary HP]] while having 0 [[#HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.

# Healing Damage
Healing damage requires a creature taking a [[#Short Rest]] and making an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical specialty heal 1d6 [[#HP]], this can only be done once before the target takes a [[#Long Rest]]. Taking a [[#Long Rest]] heals [[#HP]] equal to your [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6.  Otherwise, you will need a spell or item to heal.

# Conditions

# Move Through
A creature can move through an allied creature's space. If they end their movement in the same space they are [[#Squeezing]]. Moving through an enemy space, the area is considered [[#Difficult Terrain]]. If a creature ends their turn within another creature's space they are [[#Sharing a Space]] if they are allied, and [[#Sharing a Space]] if they are enemies.

# Squeeze

A creature is invisible if they cannot be seen, either by a spell, ability, or in complete darkness. A creature can estimate where an invisible target is with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll using senses other than sight against the the target's [[#React]]. If the target is moving stealthily they can make an opposing [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll.

Even if the target is located, all attempts to hit the creature have [[#Disadvantage]]. Spells do not have line of effect, so the creature cannot be targeted by non-area spells.

# Light Source
Each light source casts an aura of bright light of a specific radius and an aura of dim light twice the radius. Targets in dim light are within [[#Cover]].

# Terrain Opportunities
Terrain should also include features that creatures can interact with. Chandeliers to swing across, pillars to knock over, chairs to throw into enemy's faces are all things within the battlefield.

# Suffocating
A creature can suffocate for a number of rounds equal to their [[#Fortitude]] bonus. After that they begin making [[#Stabilization Roll]]s at the beginning of their turn as long as it is in the water. After three failures the creature dies.



# Long Rest
Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain your [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[#HP]]. Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour. Taking a [[#Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.

# Short Rest
Some classes have abilities that reset on a Short Rest.
