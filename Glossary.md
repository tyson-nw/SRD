# Game Master
The Game Master facilitates the game, describes the world, controls all other creatures, and is the final arbiter of the rules.

## Creature
Creatures include characters, but the Game Master should avoid controlling characters.

## NPC
Creatures that the Game Master controls. They use [[#Target Numbers]] instead of [[#Rolls]].

# Dice
This game uses dice to add randomness to the outcome of choices.
## D4
This is commonly used for small weapons.
## D6
This is the simple weapon damage die.
## D8
This is the advanced damage die.
## D10
This is the heavy or large weapon damage die.
## D12
This is they die [[#Player|Players]] roll to resolve actions.

# Rolls
When you "make a roll" you roll a [[#d12]] and add a bonus. The bonus is the sum of the [[#Stat]] used for the roll, the [[#Skill]] being used for the roll, and any [[#Expertise]] that the [[#Game Master]] agrees applies to the roll. Then you compare the total roll to the [[#Target Number]], if it roll is is equal or higher the roll succeeds. If the roll is lower than the [[#Target Number]], the roll fails.

## Target Number
The [[#Target Number]] is what the player needs to roll for success. Here are some sample target numbers to match the difficulty of the task.

## Difficulty

| Difficulty | [[#Target Number]] |
|:--:|:--:|
| Simple | 4 |
| Easy | 6 |
| Difficult | 10 |
| Hard | 14 |
| Improbable | 20 |
|Impossible|26|

## Edge
When a character has Edge they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the highest roll. If an NPC has Hindrance on a defense the attacking character has Edge on all rolls against that defense.

## Hindrance
When a character has Hindrance they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the lowest roll. If an NPC has Edge on an attack or skill the character has Hindrance when rolling their defense.

## Automatic Success
If a creature has proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] or an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed all Simple rolls. If they have both proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] and an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed on Easy rolls.  

## Bennies
As a [[#Response]] a character can spend bennies to reroll a [[#d12]]. They can have a maximum of three Bennies as any time. At the beginning of a session the character starts with two. You gain bennies by expressing your character's [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]] in play. As well, [[#Game Master|Game Masters]] and [[#Player|Players]] (with [[#Game Master]] approval) can give bennies to another [[#Player]] for exceptional roleplay.  

# Personality Traits
By playing your character's personality traits, the [[#Game Master]] rewards [[#Bennies]] that can be spent later. If you want to highlight you are playing a trait make an aside comment that you are playing to your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]]. 

## Drive
What drives your character? Why do they adventure? Why didn't they just take the same job as a parent and stay near their home? They should be active goals that are not permanently achievable but can be acted on in the moment.

- To protect those who cannot protect themselves.
- To break the bonds of tyranny.
- To live free and experience the world.
- To repay a debt I can never repay.
- To seek wealth and the pleasures it brings.

## Bond
What ideals does your character follow in everyday life? What does your character hew to? This should be something that informs how they react to their own plight and the plight of those around in the face of adversity.

- Faith provides
- Those I meet are friends until proven otherwise
- Knowledge must be preserved above all else.
- I am loyal to those who seek to do share my desire to do great deeds

## Flaw
What undermines your character? Is it your drive taken to extreme? Is it an exception that will have you set aside your bond? Is it a weakness that your character will revert to when pressed? Acting on the character's Flaw is the easiest to gain [[#Bennies]]. As well, overcoming the flaw at great cost to your character is worth gaining [[#Bennies]]. 

- I am a braggart that will bite off more than I can chew.
- I care more about enriching myself than the lives of others.
- In the face of overwhelming odds I will abandon my fellows.
- The pursuit of knowledge blinds me to the plight of others.

# Defenses
There are three Defenses, each derived from a total of two [[#Stats]].

## Body
[[#Strength]] and [[#Fortitude]] combine to make up a creature's Body defense. This is used to resist poison, [[#Massive Damage]], and other attacks on the creature's health.

## React
[[#Dexterity]] and [[#Wits]] combine to make up a creature's React defense. This is used to avoid attacks or other hazards. This is also used when making initiative rolls.

## Mind
[[#Aptitude]] and [[#Will]] combine to make up a creature's Mind defense. This is used to resist attempts to bend their will, confuse them, or otherwise attack the creatures psyche.

# Derived Stats
## Deflect
A character's Deflect is their [[#React]] defense plus any [[#Deflection]] modifier provided by the armor or shield they are wearing.

## Soak
A character's soak is their [[#Fortitude]] + the [[#Soak Bonus]] granted by their worn armor or shield. It is used to reduce the amount of damage taken, to a minimum of 1 damage.

## HP
HP, or hit points, is an abstraction of how many times a character can be hit. 

## Current HP
The creature's current HP. It can only be equal to or lesser than the Maximum HP, even if healing would increase it further. Once they fall to 0 [[#HP]] or below they begin dying.

## Maximum HP
The maximum HP a creature can have. A character's base [[#HP]] is set by their class plus their [[#Fortitude]] bonus multiplied by the character's [[#Proficiency Bonus]]. 

## Temporary HP
Temporary HP are additional beyond the character's HP. When a character gains Temporary HP they replace the current value if the new value is higher. When the character takes damage the Temporary HP goes away first.

## Proficiency Bonus
This is determined by the tier of play. Tier 1 characters have a proficiency bonus of +1 and higher tiers have higher bonuses.

## Speed
Medium creatures have a movement speed of 6 spaces. Small creatures have a movement speed of 4 spaces. As a [[#Move Act]] the creature can move up to their speed in one round, the movement doesn't need to be continuous.

## Deflection Bonus
This bonus adds to the character's [[#React]] to derive the character's [[#Deflect]]. If the [[#Deflection Bonus]] has a * then it is used as the [[#Deflect]] without the [[#React]] bonus added in.

## Soak Bonus
This bonus adds to the character's [[#Body]] to derive the character's [[#Soak]].

## Ammunition
Weapon uses ammunition that is tracked separately and may replace the damage dealt by the weapon. Ammunition breaks on misses and cannot be recovered.

## Blunt
Blunt weapons rely on impact to do damage. The weilder may choose to do non-lethal damage when they hit. If the attack would drop the target to 0 [[#HP]] or below, they have 1 [[#HP]] and are [[#Unconscious]]. 

## Charging
If the wielder moves at least half their speed before striking, deal an additional die of damage.

# Pets
Pets act on their master’s turn and are trained to [[#Withdraw]] where directed, [[#Hide]], or [[#Dodge]] in combat. Commanding a pet is a Swift Act. If attacked, and not given instructions otherwise, the pet will attack its attacker.

## Complex Rolls
Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] check. In this case the [[#Game Master]] decides on three [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls necessary to compete the task. Some of the available [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest [[#Specialties]] that might apply, but it is up to the [[#Game Master]] to allow it. Three different characters need to complete one of the three checks. Depending on how many succeed determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, as we as if it has bonuses or complications.

- **Three Successes** - succeed with a [[#Perk]].
- **Two Successes** - succeed in the task.
- **One success** - success with a [[#Complication]]
- **No successes** - failing the task
- 
## Initiative

## Turn
On each creature's initiative they can make one [[#Act]], one [[#Swift Act]], and a [[#Minor Action]].

## Round
Once each creature has gone and the round ends on initiative 0. Any Lair Acts or Environmental Events happen at this time. The total time elapsed is 6 seconds per round.

## Spaces
Spaces are an abstraction of space for the creatures to move through. They are either 5ft or 2 meters depending on your Game Master’s preference. Small and Medium-sized creatures take up a single Space. This both includes the area they fill but also the area needed to Act freely. Large creatures take up a two-by-two square of spaces. Huge creatures take up a three-by-three square of spaces. Gargantuan take up more spaces than can easily be represented on a battlefield. They 
are treated as an aspect of the terrain.

## Move Through
A creature can move through an allied creature's space. When moving through an enemy’s space, the area is considered Difficult Terrain. If a creature ends their turn within another creature's space they are Squeezing if they are allied, and Sharing a Space if they are enemies.

## Squeezing
Two allied creatures can squeeze into the same space. While they are squeezed together both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on Athletics, Weapon and Enigma rolls. As well, both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on React and Deflect defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

## Share a Space
To opposing creatures can share a space. While they share a space they both have a Hindrance on Athletics, Weapon and Enigma rolls, except for Weapon rolls with weapons with the Fine tag. As well, both creatures have a Hindrance on React and Deflect defenses. Both creatures are Exposed.

## Adjacent
Creatures who's occupied space touches another creature’s occupied space are considered adjacent.

## Threatened Spaces
The spaces that a creature can reach with a wielded weapon are considered threatened. Moving out of a threatened space will provoke a Movement Response unless the creature makes an Evade Act.

## Expose
Exposing a target makes them vulnerable to exploiting. Some conditions expose a creature to specific attacks. 

## Flanking
When allied creatures are opposite of each other with the target in the middle, the target is exposed to their flanking attackers.

## Exploit
Some abilities require a target to be exposed to exploit. 

## Act
Acts are the primary actions made in combat. They do the most, hit the hardest, or have the most spectacular effects.

### Attack
A [[#Character]] makes a [[#Weapons]]+[[#Stats|Stat]] (as appropriate for that weapon) roll against a target's [[#React]] defense. If the [[#Character]] succeeds, the attack connects and it deals damage according to the weapon's features. Some weapons have features that can be used instead of making an attack. Using those features is treated like an attack.

A [[#NPC]] declares their intent to attack a [[#Character]] and the [[#Character]] makes a [[#React]] defense against the attack's [[#Target Number]]. If the [[#Character]] succeeds the attack misses.  

### Cast a spell
To cast a spell the Player rolls [[#Spellcasting Roll]] against the target's defense listed in the spell. If a creature casts a spell of Tier 1 or higher they can no longer cast a spell as a [[#Swift Act]].

While holding a grappled enemy the grabbing creature can move at half the creature's speed.

### Help
While adjacent to a foe threatened by an ally, a creature can help that ally hit easier. The enemy is [[#Expose|Exposed]] until the beginning of the helper's next turn.

### Hide
While in full cover  a creature makes a [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creatures that cannot see the creature, then moves at least half of their movement they become [[#Hidden]]. Their position not be noticed until the enemy creature makes the [[#Swift Act]] [[#Scan the Battlefield]] or the hidden creature deals damage, casts a spell, or otherwise calls attention to themselves.

### Shove
A creature makes a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against the [[#Body]] of a target no more than one size category larger to push the target 2 spaces and knock them prone.

### Evade
The creature doesn't provoke [[#Movement Response]] when moving through spaces.

## Swift Act
Swift Acts are actions that follow the main action. They could be offhand attacks, abilities, or other actions that don't rise to a full [[#Act]].

### Offhand Attack
If a creature has a weapon with the [[#Fine]] feature it can be used to make an Offhand Attack.

### Cast a Spell
If a creature casts a spell with a [[#Swift Act]] casting time, they cannot cast another spell this round, other than a [[#Cantrip]].

### Scan the Battlefield
A creature makes a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to reveal hidden enemies.

## Minor Act
Minor Acts are saying a few words, interacting with an object, drawing a weapon, dropping an item in the creature's hand, hand off an item to another willing creature, or other simple activity that doesn't require attention while distracted by combat.

## Response
Creatures respond to another creature's action during that other creature's turn. A creature has a single response they can take between their turns unless otherwise specified.

### Movement Response 
When a creature moves out of a [[#Threatened Space]] without making a [[#withdraw]] act, the creature threatening that space can make an melee weapon attack on that creature.

## Critical Success
When a Player roll a 12 on the attack roll and the roll would hit the attack deals maximum damage. If the roll would not hit, the attack deals normal damage. 

## Critical Failure
When a Player rolls a 1 on a defense and the roll does not exceed the [[#Target Number]] their character takes maximum damage from the attack.

## Damage Resistance
If a creature has Damage Resistance they take half damage, rounded down, before applying the creature's [[#Soak]].

## Massive Damage
If a creature takes more than half of their [[#Maximum HP]] in a single attack they need to make a [[#Body]] roll against the total damage taken. Otherwise they drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]]. Creatures that take more than their [[#Maximum HP]] before applying soak drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]].

# Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[#HP]] they fall [[#Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

## Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[#Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, and on a [[#Critical Success]] they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and on a [[#Critical Failure]] they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[#HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[#HP]] stabilizes the creature. Another creature can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical Expertise to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[#Temporary [[#HP]]]] while having 0 [[#HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.

# Healing Damage
During a [[#Short Rest]] a character can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[#Expertise]]) against the creature's current HP to heal a target 1d6 [[#HP]], this can only be done to a target once taking a [[#Long Rest]]. Taking a [[#Long Rest]] heals [[#HP]] equal to the character's [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6, always healing at least one [[#HP]].  Otherwise, a spell or item can be used to heal.

Character's have [[#Edge]] on [[#React]] defenses when behind cover, and have [[#Hindrance]] on attacks against creatures who have cover.

## Full Cover
If a creature is fully obscured from the vision of their attacker either behind something solid and opaque or within darkness they have Full Cover. Attackers still know the creature is there unless the creature becomes [[#Hidden]].

## Hidden
A creature is hidden if they have moved into full cover and succeeded on [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creature then moved at least half their movement. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position not be noticed until the beginning the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell.

## Invisible
A creature is invisible if they cannot be seen, either by a spell, ability, or in complete darkness. A creature can estimate where an invisible target is with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll using senses other than sight against the the target's [[#React]]. If the target is moving stealthily they can make an opposing [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll.

Even if the target is located, all attempts to hit the creature have [[#Hindrance]]. Spells do not have line of effect, so the creature cannot be targeted by non-area spells.

## Light
Each light source casts an aura of bright light of a specific radius and an aura of dim light twice the radius. 

### Daylight
Daylight is natural light from the sun. Its dim light is still considered daylight.

### Bright Light
Bright light is easy to see in and confers no cover to creatures within it.

### Dim Light
Dim Light is difficult to see in. Targets in dim light are within [[#Cover]].

### Darkness
Creatures in darkness are efectively [[#Invisible]].

### Light Sources
* Candle, 1 space [[#Aura]] of bright light
* Torch, 4 space [[#Aura]] of bright light
* Lantern, 6 space [[#Aura]] of bright light 
* Hooded Lantern, 3 space [[#Cone]] of bright light
* Daylight, when cast through an opening the bright light fills the three times the amount of space as the opening.

## Terrain

## Hazardous Terrain
Hazardous terrain is [[#Difficult Terrain]] that also deals damage when a character begins their turn within the area or and they move through the area.

### Swimming
Unless a creature has a swim speed they move at half speed. In armor they need to make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll with a [[#Target Number]] of 6 + the armor and shield's [[#Deflection Bonus]]  every round or begin to sink.

### Holding Breath
A creature makes a [[#Swift Act]] to hold their breath. They can hold it for as many rounds as a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll. If a creature takes damage while holding their breath a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll against the damage taken is required. If the creature fails they begin suffocating.

### Suffocating
A creature can suffocate for a number of rounds equal to their [[#Fortitude]] bonus. After that they begin making [[#Stabilization Roll]]s at the beginning of their turn as long as it is in the water.

## Long Rest
Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain their [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[#HP]]. Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour.  Doing actions that take place during a [[#Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.

## Short Rest
Short Rests are an hour of relaxation. Some [[#Features]] and [[#Magic Items]] reset on a Short Rest.

# Tier
There are four tiers of play. It is advised that characters move to a new tier after a handful of adventures. The precise amount of adventures is up to the Game Master.

|Tiers| Proficiency Bonus | Additional Specialties| Recommended Adventures |
