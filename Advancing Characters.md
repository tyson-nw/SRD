As the story progresses the characters improve.

## Tier
There are four tiers of play. It is advised that characters move to a new tier after a handful of adventures. The precise amount of adventures is up to the Game Master, but two to four adventures at each tier are recommended. It is also advised that advancement takes place during Downtime.

| Tiers | Proficiency Bonus | Additional Expertises |     |
| :---: | :---------------: | :-------------------: | --- |
|   1   |        +1         |           0           |     |
|   2   |        +2         |           1           |     |
|   3   |        +3         |           2           |     |
|   4   |        +4         |           3           |     |

When advancing to the next Tier, the character's [[HP]] increases by their class' base [[HP]] plus their [[Fortitude]] modifier. The player can choose a new [[Expertise]] either from the list of [[Expertise|Expertises]], or create your own. 
## Developing character.
As your character grows and changes, what they care about and how they fail themselves may change. Revisit your Drive and Flaw, do they still apply? Or has your character moved beyond them. If so, come up with a new Drive and Flaw.

## Advanced Archetypes
A character's Archetype provides the choice of new [[Features]] with each tier. When choosing [[Features]] of a new tier, [[Features]] of a previous tier are also available to be chosen. If a [[Features|Feature]] has the same name as one from a previous Tier, replace the old [[Features|Feature]] with the new [[Features|Feature]].
