#### Aquatic Terrain

##### Swimming
Unless a creature has a swim speed they move at half speed. In armor they need to make a [[Strength]]+[[Athletics]] roll with a [[Target Number]] of 6 + the armor and shield's [[Deflection Bonus]]  every round or begin to sink uncontrollably at 3 spaces per [[Round]].

##### Holding Breath
A creature makes a [[Maneuver]] to hold their breath by making a [[Fortitude]]+[[Focus]] roll, they can hold it for as many rounds as a the roll. If a creature takes damage while holding their breath a [[Fortitude]]+[[Focus]] roll against the damage taken is required. If the creature fails they begin [[Suffocating]].
