# Enchanted Items
Enchanted Items are treasures that adds [[Features]] to a creature that wields, wears, or holds it.

## Designing an Item
Enchanted Items shouldn't give bonuses to [[Stats]], but grant the character new [[Features]] or increase the damage they can do with their existing actions.

### Item Tier
Items may have an appropriate tier for characters to acquire them. These are not requirements, characters can use an item of any tier.

### Enchanted Ammunition
Enchanted Ammunition breaks and cannot be recovered when expended. Thrown weapons can be enchanted as ammunition and will not break on misses.

### [[Attuned]]
![[Attuned]]
### Armor
Any type of armor can be enchanted. 

### Artifact
Artifacts are powerful items that have multiple aspects.

### Consumable
Consumable items can be used once and then they are destroyed.

### Foci
Some items can also be used as a spellcasting foci.
### Legacy
Legacy items have [[Features|Feature]] based on the Tier of the wielder. Legacy items must be [[Attuned]] to use. When gaining a new [[Features|Feature]], it does not replace a previous [[Features|Feature]] unless it has the same name. With the unlock of each new [[Features|Feature]] the item needs to be re-identified at the new Tier to determine how to activate the new [[Features|Feature]]. Most Legacy items have a base form, this can be broad encompassing a wide range of forms, or specific limiting their enchantment to a single form.

### Recharge
Some items' abilities have a limited amount of uses between Long Rests.

### Weapon
Unless otherwise noted in the description, the weapon can take any form. The item may have an advised tag that the form should have.

## Identifying an Enchanted Item

Enchanted Items have a preternatural shine to them that distinguishes them from mundane item. The investigator rolls [[Aptitude]]+[[Craft]] plus the Arcana [[Expertise]] against a [[Target Number]] to identify the item and its [[Features|Feature]].

If a creature attunes to an item before identifying its [[Features]], they can make a [[Aptitude]]+[[Focus]] toll against the [[Target Number]] to learn its [[Features]]

| Tier   | [[Target Number]] |
| :----- | :---------------- |
| Tier 1 | [[Easy]]          |
| Tier 2 | [[Moderate]]      |
| Tier 3 | [[Hard]]          |
| Tier 4 | [[Improbable]]    |

For consumable items the investigator can use the Alchemy Expertise and an Apothecary Pouch gives an Edge on their identification roll.


### Identifying an Artifact
Determining their [[Features]] required knowledge of what artifact you are identifying or making a Hard [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll with any [[Expertise#History]] [[Expertise|Expertises]] to identify the artifact and learn its history. As a [[Perk]] the investigator also learns how to activate one [[Features|Feature]]. As a [[Complication]] the artifact is misidentified and all subsequent rolls to investigate its aspects have a [[Hindrance]] until a successful investigation happens.  

A creature that can see magic can spend a week to make an [[Improbable]] [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll with the Arcana expertise to determine one [[Features|Feature]] of the artifact. As a [[Perk]] the investigator also learns how to activate the [[Features|Feature]]. As a [[Complication]] one aspect is misidentified and its activation deals damage or causes a [[Complication]] every time it is activated. This continues until the investigator spends a week and makes a successful [[Improbable]] [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll with any [[Expertise#History|History]] [[Expertise|Expertises]].
