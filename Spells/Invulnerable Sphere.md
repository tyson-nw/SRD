The area is encased in a translucent impenetrable wall of force with a6 spaces hover speed that the caster can move as a [[Maneuver]]. Only the caster has [[Line of Effect]] through the sphere. Teleportation and other spells cast from within the sphere that have an effect beyond the [[Sphere]] do not succeed. The [[Disintegrate]] spell destroys the sphere and leaves the contents unharmed.
