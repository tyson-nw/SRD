## Locate Object
- **Tier** 1 Wizard
- **Casting Time** Ritual
- **Target** 10 miles
- **Duration** -

Learn the direction to an object, the distance to an object, and a snapshot of the area around the object from its perspective. If the caster has had the object in their possession, it is a Simple roll, if they have seen the object it is an Easy roll, if they have seen a drawing it is a Hard roll, and if they have only heard a description it is a Desperate roll. When cast at a higher Tier, multiply the Target by 10 for each Tier beyond 1st.
