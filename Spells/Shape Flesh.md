Change the caster's form to give them one new capability. They can adapt to an aquatic environment with a 6 space [[Swim]] speed, grow functional wings with a 6 space [[Fly]] speed, grow armor plates that increase their [[Soak]] by 2, or gain a natural weapon that deals 1d6 damage per character Tier. When cast at a higher Tier, the caster can add an additional capability for every Tier beyond 1st.
