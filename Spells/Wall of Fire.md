## Wall of Fire
- **Tier** 3 [Wildshaper](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Archetypes/Wildshaper.md), [Wizard](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Archetypes/Wizard.md)
- **Casting Time** [Action](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Glossary/Action.md)
- **Target** 6 space [Range](app://obsidian.md/Range), [Wall](app://obsidian.md/Wall), [React](app://obsidian.md/React)
- **Duration** 1 minute, [Concentration](app://obsidian.md/Concentration)

The wall acts as cover. Creatures within the wall when it manifests take 6d6 damage. Moving through the wall deals 6d6 damage. When casting at a higher Tier, the spell does an additional 4d6 damage for every Tier above 3rd. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration becomes [[Permanent]] and no longer requires Concentration.
