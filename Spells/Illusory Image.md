Fill the area with illusory images that move and make noise. Interacting with the illusion allows a creature to make a [[Mind]] Defense against the [[Spellcasting Roll]]. When cast at a higher Tier, increase the [[Sphere]] radius by 2 spaces for every Tier over 2nd. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration becomes one hour.
