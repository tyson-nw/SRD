Open a 2 spaces by 2 spaces portal to the plane of the caster's choice that can be traversed from either side. If the target location has a [[Teleportation Anchor]] the caster knows, it is a [[Moderate]] roll. If the caster has been to the place, it is a [[Hard]] roll. If the caster has seen a drawing it is an [[Improbable]] roll. And if the caster has only heard a description it is an [[Impossible]] roll.  If the roll is failed the other portal opens in a random location on the target plane. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration increases to 1 day.
