Control the weather within the area. As an [[Maneuver]] the caster can roll their [[Spellcasting Roll]] against a target's [[React]] to call down a lightning bolt that strikes a single target dealing 3d8 damage. As an Action the caster can roll their [[Spellcasting Roll]] to summon a whirlwind as 2 space Sphere that throws creatures within its area 4 spaces and dealing 3d6 damage to them and knocking them prone if the roll beats the target's [[Body]] defense. When cast at a higher Tier, increase the damage die by 2 for every Tier beyond 3rd. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration increases to 1 day.
