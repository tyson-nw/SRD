Target takes 2d8 damage. During each of the caster turns they can continue the spell with a [[Maneuver]]. Subsequent rounds automatically hit. On the target's next round they have a [[Hindrance]] on all rolls. If the target leaves the range or gains [[Full Cover]] the spell ends. When cast at a higher Tier, add an additional 1d8 for each Tier beyond 1st.
