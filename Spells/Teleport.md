## Teleport
- **Tier** `= this.tier` `= this.classes`
- **Casting Time** `= this.casting-time`
- **Target** `= this.target`
- **Duration** `= this.duration`

The caster can teleport themselves and five additional willing creatures to a place on the current plane.  If the target has a [[Teleportation Anchor]] the caster knows, it is a [[Easy]] roll. If the caster has been to the place, it is a [[Moderate]] roll. If the caster has seen a drawing it is an [[Hard]] roll. And if the caster has only heard a description it is an [[Improbable]] roll. On a failure the teleported creatures materialize in a random place within a mile of the target.  When cast at a higher Tier, add two willing creatures for every Tier beyond 2nd.
