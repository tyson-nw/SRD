Shift into a well known place on another Plane or to a location in the Material plane from any other Plane. If the target location has a [[Teleportation Anchor]] the caster knows, it is a [[Moderate]] roll. If the caster has been to the place, it is a [[Hard]] roll. If the caster has seen a drawing it is an [[Improbable]] roll. And if the caster has only heard a description it is an [[Impossible]] roll.  If the roll is failed the caster materializes in a random location. When cast at a higher Tier, the caster can shift back to the spells origin as Response.
