Perceive the area around the target person or item. If the caster personally knows the target it is an Easy roll. It the caster has seen the target, or has a piece of the target, it is a Difficult roll. If the caster has a drawing or representations of the target, or a personal item of the Target, it is a Hard roll. It the caster only has a description it is an Improbable roll. When cast at a higher tier, if the target is on another plane the difficulty is [[Improbable]].
