## Time Stop
- **Tier** `= this.tier` `= this.classes`
- **Casting Time** `= this.casting-time`
- **Target** `= this.target`
- **Duration** `= this.duration`


Time stops for the world but the caster can move, cast spells, and interact with objects normally. Time passes for the caster and objects held by the caster. Spells freeze at the point of casting and only complete after the Time Stop ends. If cast as a [[Ritual]], the duration becomes 1 day.
