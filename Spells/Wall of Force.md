- **Casting Time** [Action](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Glossary/Action.md)
- **Target** 6 space [Range](app://obsidian.md/Range), [Wall](app://obsidian.md/Wall)

A translucent impenetrable wall manifests that blocks [[Line of Effect]] except for the caster's spells. The wall is destroyed when hit with [[Disintegrate]]. When cast at a higher Tier, the duration becomes 1 hour for every Tier beyond 3rd. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration becomes [[Permanent]] and no longer requires Concentration.
