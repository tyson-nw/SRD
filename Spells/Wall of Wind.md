## Wall of Wind
- **Tier** 2 [Wildshaper](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Archetypes/Wildshaper.md), [Wizard](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Archetypes/Wizard.md)
- **Casting Time** [Action](app://obsidian.md/SRD/Glossary/Action.md)
- **Target** 6 space [Range](app://obsidian.md/Range), [Wall](app://obsidian.md/Wall)
- **Duration** 1 minute, [Concentration](app://obsidian.md/Concentration)

The wall acts as cover, and ranged weapons cannot fire through it. Creatures within the wall when it manifests are pushed out of the wall away from the caster. Moving through the wall requires a [[Strength]]+[[Athletics]] roll against the [[Spellcasting Roll]]. If cast as a [[Ritual]] the duration becomes [[Permanent]] and no longer requires Concentration.
