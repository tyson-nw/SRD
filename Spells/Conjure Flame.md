A torch sized flame appears in the casters hand that can be used it to light fires. As a [[Maneuver]] the caster can fling a flame up to 6 spaces by rolling [[Spellcasting Roll]] against the target's Deflect that deals 1d6 damage. As a [[Perk]] the target gains the [[Burning]] condition. Flinging the flame does not end the spell. Increase the die for every Tier the caster is beyond 1st.
