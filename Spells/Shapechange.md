Become any creature of the caster's choice, gaining their [[Strength]], [[Fortitude]], [[Dexterity]], any [[Features]], and natural weapons. If masquerading as a specific person, their [[Spellcasting Roll]] becomes the [[Target Number]] to see through their disguise. If cast as a [[Ritual]], the duration becomes one day.
