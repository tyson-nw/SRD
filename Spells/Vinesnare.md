Targets are [[Restrained]]. When the spell is cast, and at the beginning each of their turns, restrained foes take 3d6 damage. The caster must re-roll their attack against the Targetâ€™s [[Body]] or they escape, failing to overcome the caster's [[Burn]] does not end the spell. The area becomes [[Difficult Terrain]] for the duration. When cast at a higher Tier, increase the damage by 2d6 for each Tier beyond 2nd.
