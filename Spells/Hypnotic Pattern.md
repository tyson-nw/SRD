## Hypnotic Pattern
- **Tier** = 1 Wizard
- **Casting Time** Action
- **Target** 12 space Range, 3 space Sphere, Mind
- **Duration** -

Targets are incapacitated and charmed by the caster. If the target takes damage the target is released from the spell. When cast at a higher Tier, increase the radius of the spell by 1 space for every Tier over 2nd.
