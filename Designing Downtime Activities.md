Downtime actions should either require a Complex Roll to achieve over a single [[Downtime]] either as a group or solo without [[Hindrance]] on multiple rolls. Or they should require a single roll where successes are tallied over multiple [[Downtime|Downtimes]]. As with all other rolls they should have [[Perk|Perks]] and [[Complication|Complications]] associated with the [[Rolls]]. 

#### Difficulty by Tier

The difficulty of a task can be tied to the Tier of the task.

| Tier |   Difficulty   |
| :--: | :------------: |
|  1   |    [[Easy]]    |
|  2   |  [[Moderate]]  |
|  3   |    [[Hard]]    |
|  4   | [[Improbable]] |

#### Downtime Rewards
If the Downtime Activity has a monetary reward, it should generally correspond to a to the [[Difficulty]] of the task.

|   Reward    |   Difficulty   |
| :---------: | :------------: |
|  [[Poor]]   |    [[Easy]]    |
| [[Common]]  |  [[Moderate]]  |
| [[Wealthy]] |    [[Hard]]    |
|  [[Noble]]  | [[Improbable]] |

#### Bribery
A roll on a downtime activity can be made easier by greasing palms. Bribing grants an [[Edge]] on a roll based on the [[Difficulty]] of the [[Complex Roll]].

|   Difficulty   | Coin  |
| :------------: | :---: |
|    [[Easy]]    |   5   |
|  [[Moderate]]  |  50   |
|    [[Hard]]    |  500  |
| [[Improbable]] | 5,000 |
