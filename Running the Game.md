## When Should Players Roll
The [[Game Master]] should only call for a roll if the outcome of the roll would push the story forward or create an opportunity for additional roleplay. Keep in mind the characters’ [[Automatic Success]] at [[Simple]] and [[Easy]] tasks depending on their [[Skills]] and [[Expertise|Expertises]]. When a player comes up with a clever solution that would be easy to pull off, or argue their point with eloquence, the [[Game Master]] can declare they succeed without a roll. If the Game Master doesn’t think their idea rises to the level an [[Automatic Success]], they earn a [[Bennies|Bennie]] for the effort.

When calling for a roll the Game Master should explain the consequences of a success on the roll, the consequences of a failure, and potential [[Complication|Complications]]. The potential [[Perk]] can be held back as a surprise for the players.

Players will often offer to roll to achieve a task. Before they do, the Game Master should ask what they are trying to achieve before the player rolls. The Game Master needs to know what the desired result is before they can determine the [[Difficulty]] of the action and what the appropriate [[Complication]] and [[Perk]] is before the roll. Also, the [[Player]] may have one idea of what they can achieve that contradicts what the [[Game Master]] thinks. It is best to resolve that ambiguity before the roll is made.

### [[Complex Roll]]
![[Complex Roll]]

Some examples of Complex Rolls are:

#### Escaping through a crowd
The party can disappear into a crowd with a [[Moderate]] Complex Roll by spotting pursuers and openings with a [[Wits]]+[[Senses]] roll; leading the group from cover to cover with a [[Dexterity]]+[[Stealth]] roll or maneuver the crowd between the party and the pursuers with a [[Dexterity]]+[[Social]] roll; and moving quickly with a [[Strength]]+[[Athletics]] roll or moving nimbly with a [[Dexterity]]+[[Athletics]] roll against the [[React]] defense of their pursuers to shake them. As a [[Perk]] the party can maneuver their pursuers to the place of their choosing. As a [[Complication]], they run into a different group of enemies. On failure the party is tracked by their enemy.

#### Runaway carriage
The party can stop a runaway carriage with a [[Moderate]] Complex Roll of taking control of the reins with a [[Strength]]+[[Athletics]] or recovering the fallen reins [[Dexterity]]+[[Athletics]]; maneuvering the vehicle [[Wits]]+[[Pilot]]; and controlling the animals with a [[Will]]+[[Social]] with a [[Target Number]] of 10. As [[Perk]] they bring the carriage under control without stopping. As a [[Complication]], one of the passengers is thrown from the carriage taking 3d6 damage. On failure the beasts don't stop until the carriage breaks and all the passengers take 3d6 damage.

#### Tracking a creature. 
The party can track a creature through the wilds with a [[Moderate]] Complex Roll unless the creature is moving stealthily. Then the Target Number is 6 + the creature's [[Wits]] + [[Stealth]].  They read trail signs of the target's passing with a [[Wits]]+[[Knowledge]]; spot trail signs and movement in the brush with a [[Wits]]+[[Senses]]; and either sneak on the target without giving their position away with a [[Dexterity]]+[[Stealth]] or rush to overtake them with a [[Strength]]+[[Athletics]]. As a [[Perk]] they are able to catch the creature totally unaware. As a [[Complication]], the target has lured the party into an ambush. On a failure the target slips their grasp and as a [[Complication]] a hostile creature is stalking the party.

### Actions in combat

Creatures have access to four acts that they can take in combat: [[Action]], [[Maneuver]], [[Interaction]], and [[Response]]

#### [[Action]]

##### Cast a Spell
Some spells can be cast as a [[Maneuver]]. This restricts the complexity of magic they can cast in the same turn. If a creature casts a spell with a [[Maneuver]] casting time, they cannot cast another spell this turn of Tier 1 or higher. Similarly a creature cannot cast a spell as a [[Maneuver]] if they already cast a spell of Tier 1 or higher this turn.

## Dealing Damage
When dealing damage, the source of the damage has a damage die listed. Roll that and apply the target's [[Soak]]. Subtract the remaining damage from the target's [[Temporary HP]] then, if there is any damage remaining, the target's [[Current HP]]. If the attack deals more damage than the creature has [[Current HP]], the creature's [[HP]] becomes 0 and they begin [[Dying]].

### [[Damage Resistance]]

## Healing Damage
During a [[Short Rest]] a character can make an [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[Expertise]]) against the creature's current HP to heal a target 1d6 [[HP]] and remove all [[Bleeding]] [[Conditions]], this can only be done to a target once before taking a [[Long Rest]]. Taking a [[Long Rest]] heals [[HP]] equal to the character's [[Body]] modifier + 1d6 times the Tier, always healing at least one [[HP]].  Otherwise, a spell or item can be used to heal.

### Healer's Kit
Healers kit grant an [[Edge]] when healing damage. As an Action the healers kit can be used to end all [[Bleeding]] conditions.

## Mounts, Vehicles, and the Chase

### [[Mounts]]

### Chases
With chases there are two things you need to keep in mind for each participant; their current speed and their distance from each other. It is best to visualize all participants in a single line, with those at the same point on the line considered adjacent. At the end of each round, you recalculate the current speed and distance based off the actions of the participants.

Every participant starts at a set distance from each other. The first acting participants can move their full speed before the chase begins.

#### Pilots and Passengers
Even if the pilot and passengers of a vehicle are going on the same turn, the pilot declares and resolves their acts before the passengers can.

#### [[Chase Maneuvers]]
![[Chase Maneuvers]]

#### [[Terrain Hazards]]
![[Terrain Hazards]]

#### Chase Complications
- **Glancing Blow** - The participant hits a hazard but doesn’t slow. Participants take 1d6 damage for every 4 spaces of speed beyond 6 that they were traveling at.
- **Rattled** - The participant has a [[Hindrance]] on [[Skill Rolls]] for their next [[Turn]].
- **Slowed** - The participant moves back along the line by half their current speed.

#### Chase Perks
- **Shortcut** - The participant additionally moves their speed. This doesn't increase their speed but does change their distance from other participants.
- **Interference** - If the participant is ahead of another, they use the environment to increase lead a pursuer into [[Difficult Terrain]] or [[Hazardous Terrain]].
- **Lock On** - If the participant is behind another, they have advantage on [[Action|Actions]] that target the other participant.
