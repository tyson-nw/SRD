## Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[HP]] they fall [[Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

### Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, if they roll a 12 on the die, they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and if they roll a 1 on the die, they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[HP]] stabilizes the creature. As an [[Action]], another creature can make an [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll (adding any relevant medical Expertise) to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[Temporary HP]]]] while having 0 [[HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.
