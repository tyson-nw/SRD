### Difficulty
Once you decide a roll is necessary you need to set the difficulty. The difficulty should be tailored to the task at hand, not the Tier of the characters. While higher Tier characters will have increased bonuses from [[Skills]] and [[Expertise|Expertises]] the difficulty should stay the same based on the challenge of the task regardless of Tier. However, the difficulty should not change based on the potential consequences of a roll. Jumping over a small fissure may be [[Easy]], but depending on the depth the consequences for failure can be dire.
