## Elevator Pitch Brainstorming

Neosys (name pending) is a fantasy RPG that focuses on tactical combat with robust roleplaying and non-combat support. Its goal is to create an SRD that supports a game that is slightly less complex than D&D but still feels familiar. We are aiming for a game with more complexity than your average Indy title. It should include modern affordances that OSR games tend to eschew.
