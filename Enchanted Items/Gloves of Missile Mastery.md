### Gloves of Missile Mastery
_`= this.item`_ 

Base item is a fine pair of gloves.
1. **Fingertip Storage** - The gloves can store 40 pieces of ammunition and any amount of chosen ammunition can be recalled with a [[Interaction]].
2. **Catch Arrows** - As a [[#Response]] the wearer can roll [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Focus]] to snatch ammunition fired at them. If that roll beats the attacker’s [[#Deflect]] they can chose to fire the ammunition back dealing the same damage they would have taken if the ammunition had hit.
3. **Catch Missiles** - As a [[#Response]] the wearer can roll [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Focus]] to snatch all ranged weapons fired at them regardless of size fired at them or a creature adjacent to them.  If that roll beats the attacker’s [[#Deflect]] they can chose to fire the ammunition back dealing the same damage they would have taken if the ammunition had hit.
4. **Catch Magic** - As a [[#Response]] the wearer can roll [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Focus]] to snatch a spell targeting their [[#Deflect]] defense. If that roll beats the attacker’s [[#Deflect]] they can chose to fire the spell back dealing the same damage and having the same effect they would have experienced if the spell had hit.
