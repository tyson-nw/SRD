## Game Master
The Game Master facilitates the game, describes the world, controls all other creatures, and is the final arbiter of the rules.

### Creature
Creatures include characters, but the Game Master should avoid controlling characters.

### NPC
Creatures that the Game Master controls. They use [[#Target Numbers]] instead of [[#Rolls]].

## Dice
This game uses dice to add randomness to the outcome of choices.
### D4
This is commonly used for small weapons.
### D6
This is the simple weapon damage die.
### D8
This is the advanced damage die.
### D10
This is the heavy or large weapon damage die.
### D12
This is they die [[#Player|Players]] roll to resolve actions.

## Rolls
When you "make a roll" you roll a [[#d12]] and add a bonus. The bonus is the sum of the [[#Stat]] used for the roll, the [[#Skill]] being used for the roll, and any [[#Expertise]] that the [[#Game Master]] agrees applies to the roll. Then you compare the total roll to the [[#Target Number]], if it roll is is equal or higher the roll succeeds. If the roll is lower than the [[#Target Number]], the roll fails.

### Target Number
The [[#Target Number]] is what the player needs to roll for success. Here are some sample target numbers to match the difficulty of the task.

#### Difficulty

| Difficulty | [[#Target Number]] |
|:--:|:--:|
| Simple | 4 |
| Easy | 6 |
| Difficult | 10 |
| Hard | 14 |
| Improbable | 20 |
| Impossible|26|

### 1's and 12's
Rolling a 1 on the [[#d12]] is an always a fail. Rolling a 1 on a [[#Defenses|Defense]] is a [[#Critical Failure]], unless the roll would hit the target number, then it is just a Failure.

Rolling a 12 on the [[#d12]], if the total roll is greater than the [[#Target Number]] it is a [[#Critical Success]]. If the total roll is not greater than the [[#Target Number]] it is a Success.

### Edges and Hindrances
Instead of gaining transient bonuses characters are granted an [[#Edge]] or [[#Hindrance]] on [[#d12]] rolls. Because players roll the dice, if NPCs gain Edge or Hindrance the players roll the inverse against their defense or attack.

#### Edge
When a character has Edge they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the highest roll. If an NPC has Hindrance on a defense the attacking character has Edge on all rolls against that defense.

#### Hindrance
When a character has Hindrance they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the lowest roll. If an NPC has Edge on an attack or skill the character has Hindrance when rolling their defense.

### Automatic Success
If a creature has proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] or an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed all Simple rolls. If they have both proficiency in a [[#Skills|Skill]] and an applicable [[#Expertise]] they automatically succeed on Easy rolls.  

### Bennies
As a [[#Response]] a character can spend bennies to reroll a [[#d12]]. They can have a maximum of three Bennies as any time. At the beginning of a session the character starts with two. You gain bennies by expressing your character's [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]] in play. As well, [[#Game Master|Game Masters]] and [[#Player|Players]] (with [[#Game Master]] approval) can give bennies to another [[#Player]] for exceptional roleplay.  

### Rolling as a NPC
The [[#Game Master]] never rolls a [[#d12]], so when an NPC would need to roll add 5 to the applicable bonuses and that becomes the [[#Target Number]] to overcome that roll.

### Rolling Other Dice 
If a different die is required other than the [[#d12]] the die will be noted. This is most often done when rolling damage. There may be a bonus that is applied to this one roll and the applicable [[#Stat]] will be noted. 

# Character Creation
The character is the vessel through which the player experiences the game. To create your character you decide on your tropes then choose your character's ancestry, culture, background, class, and assign their stats. After deriving the [[#Deflect]], [[#HP]], [[#Proficiency Bonus]], [[#Soak]], and [[#Speed]] your character is complete and ready to play.

## Personality Traits
By playing your character's personality traits, the [[#Game Master]] rewards [[#Bennies]] that can be spent later. If you want to highlight you are playing a trait make an aside comment that you are playing to your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]]. 

### Drive

- To live free and experience the world.
- To repay a debt I can never repay.
- To seek wealth and the pleasures it brings.

### Bond

- Faith provides
- Those I meet are friends until proven otherwise
- Knowledge must be preserved above all else.
- I am loyal to those who seek to do share my desire to do great deeds

### Flaw
What undermines your character? Is it your drive taken to extreme? Is it an exception that will have you set aside your bond? Is it a weakness that your character will revert to when pressed? Acting on the character's Flaw is the easiest to gain [[#Bennies]]. As well, overcoming the flaw at great cost to your character is worth gaining [[#Bennies]]. 

- I am a braggart that will bite off more than I can chew.
- I care more about enriching myself than the lives of others.
- In the face of overwhelming odds I will abandon my fellows.

### Creating Expertises
Specialties are short descriptions of a realm of experience. They should not be too specific, but not as broad as the Expertises gained from [[#Culture]] or [[#Background]] or [[#Class]].

## Defenses
There are three Defenses, each derived from a total of two [[#Stats]].

### Body
[[#Strength]] and [[#Fortitude]] combine to make up a creature's Body defense. This is used to resist poison, [[#Massive Damage]], and other attacks on the creature's health.

### React
[[#Dexterity]] and [[#Wits]] combine to make up a creature's React defense. This is used to avoid attacks or other hazards. This is also used when making initiative rolls.

### Mind
[[#Aptitude]] and [[#Will]] combine to make up a creature's Mind defense. This is used to resist attempts to bend their will, confuse them, or otherwise attack the creatures psyche.

## Derived Stats
### Deflect
A character's Deflect is their [[#React]] defense plus any [[#Deflection]] modifier provided by the armor or shield they are wearing.

### Soak
A character's soak is their [[#Fortitude]] + the [[#Soak Bonus]] granted by their worn armor or shield. It is used to reduce the amount of damage taken, to a minimum of 1 damage.

### HP
HP, or hit points, is an abstraction of how many times a character can be hit. 

#### Current HP
The creature's current HP. It can only be equal to or lesser than the Maximum HP, even if healing would increase it further. Once they fall to 0 [[#HP]] or below they begin dying.

#### Maximum HP
The maximum HP a creature can have. A character's base [[#HP]] is set by their class plus their [[#Fortitude]] bonus multiplied by the character's [[#Proficiency Bonus]]. 

#### Temporary HP
Temporary HP are additional beyond the character's HP. When a character gains Temporary HP they replace the current value if the new value is higher. When the character takes damage the Temporary HP goes away first.

### Proficiency Bonus
This is determined by the tier of play. Tier 1 characters have a proficiency bonus of +1 and higher tiers have higher bonuses.

### Speed
Medium creatures have a movement speed of 6 spaces. Small creatures have a movement speed of 4 spaces. As a [[#Move Act]] the creature can move up to their speed in one round, the movement doesn't need to be continuous.

# Equipment
## Armor
A character can increase their [[#Deflect]] defense and [[#Soak]] by wearing armor. Creatures only gain the benefits of wearing a single armor and wielding a single shield.

|Armor | Deflection | Soak | Tags | Cost |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|:--:|
| Leather | +0 | +1 | [[#light armor]] | 50 |
| Hide | +1 | +2 | [[#light armor]] | 75 |
| Brigantine | +1 | +3 | [[#light armor]] | 125 |
| Chainmail | +2 | +2 | [[#medium armor]], [[#noisy]] | 300 |
| Scale mail | +2 | +3 | [[#medium armor]], [[#noisy]] | 350 |
| Breastplate | 4* | +4 | [[#medium armor]] | 500 |
| Plate | 5* | +4 | [[#heavy armor]], [[#noisy]] | 3,000 |
| Shield | +1 | 0 | [[#shield]] | 50 |

### Deflection Bonus
This bonus adds to the character's [[#React]] to derive the character's [[#Deflect]]. If the [[#Deflection Bonus]] has a * then it is used as the [[#Deflect]] without the [[#React]] bonus added in.

### Soak Bonus
This bonus adds to the character's [[#Body]] to derive the character's [[#Soak]].

### Donning and Removing Armor
| Tag | Don | Remove |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute |
| Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield | 1 act | 1 act | 

## Weapons
Weapons are items that are used to make weapon attacks. Unless otherwise specified the weapon is a melee weapon with a 1 space reach.

## Pets
Pets act on their master’s turn and are trained to [[#Withdraw]] where directed, [[#Hide]], or [[#Dodge]] in combat. Commanding a pet is a Swift Act. If attacked, and not given instructions otherwise, the pet will attack its attacker.

| Animal | Cost|
|:--|:--:|
|[[#Donkey]]|75|
|[[#Horse]]|300|
|[[#Hunting Hawk]]|400|
| [[#Mastiff]] |200|

### Training Pets

Purchased pets are already trained. Training a pet to rely on a character takes 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]] days, working 2 hours per day. At the end of each training day roll a [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] vs 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]]. On a failed roll add another day to the training. Between trainings, a [[#Beast]] will follow its master but [[#Hide]] in combat.

### Training Pets for Combat

Training a pet for combat takes time. If purchasing one multiply the cost of the animal by 10. It takes as many weeks as the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]], working 2 hours per day. At the end of each week roll  [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] vs 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]]. On a failed roll add another week to the training. Once trained, the pet can also be commanded to Attack or Help a target as a Swift Act.

# Running the Game

## When to Roll
Something advice on when to roll, reiterate the difficulty table?

### Complex Rolls
Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] check. In this case the [[#Game Master]] decides on three [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls necessary to compete the task. Some of the available [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest [[#Specialties]] that might apply, but it is up to the [[#Game Master]] to allow it. Three different characters need to complete one of the three checks. Depending on how many succeed determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, as we as if it has bonuses or complications.

- **Three Successes** - succeed with a [[#Perk]].
- **Two Successes** - succeed in the task.
- **One success** - success with a [[#Complication]]
- **No successes** - failing the task

Some examples of complex tasks are:

#### Escaping through a crowd
The party can disappear into a crowd with a shared challenge of spotting pursuers and openings with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll, lead the group from cover to cover with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll or maneuver the crowd between the party and the pursuers with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Social]] roll, and to move quickly with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll or move nimbly with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the [[#React]] defense of their pursuers to shake them. As a [[#Perk]] the party can maneuver their pursuers to the place of their choosing. As a Complication, they run into a different group of enemies. On failure the party is tracked.

#### Runaway carriage
The party can stop of a runaway carriage with a shared challenge of taking control of the reins with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] or recover the fallen reins [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Athletics]], maneuver the vehicle [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]], control the animals with a [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] with a [[#Target Number]] of 10. As [[#Perk]] they bring the carriage under control without stopping. As a Complication, one of the characters is thrown from the carriage. On failure the beasts don't stop until the carriage breaks.

#### Tracking a creature. 
The party can track a creature through the wilds with a shared challenge of reading trail signs of the target's passing with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Knowledge]], spot trail signs and movement in the brush with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]], and move on the target without giving their position away with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] or rushing to overtake them with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against a [[#Target Number]] of 4+Creature Tier, unless the target is moving stealthily then it is 6+ the creature's [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]], whichever is higher. As a [[#Perk]] they are able to catch the creature totally unaware. As a Complication, the target has lured the party into an ambush. On a failure the target slips their grasp.

## Combat

### Initiative
All characters roll their [[#React]] defense to determine their initiative score. Creatures initiative score is their [[#React]] defense. Creatures and characters go in order from highest to lowest.

### Turn
On each creature's initiative they can make one [[#Act]], one [[#Swift Act]], and a [[#Minor Action]].

### Round
Once each creature has gone and the round ends on initiative 0. Any Lair Acts or Environmental Events happen at this time. The total time elapsed is 6 seconds per round.

### Spaces
Spaces are an abstraction of space for the creatures to move through. They are either 5ft or 2 meters depending on your Game Master’s preference. Small and Medium-sized creatures take up a single Space. This both includes the area they fill but also the area needed to Act freely. Large creatures take up a two-by-two square of spaces. Huge creatures take up a three-by-three square of spaces. Gargantuan take up more spaces than can easily be represented on a battlefield. They 
are treated as an aspect of the terrain.

### Move Through
A creature can move through an allied creature's space. When moving through an enemy’s space, the area is considered Difficult Terrain. If a creature ends their turn within another creature's space they are Squeezing if they are allied, and Sharing a Space if they are enemies.

### Squeezing
Two allied creatures can squeeze into the same space. While they are squeezed together both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on Athletics, Weapon and Enigma rolls. As well, both creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on React and Deflect defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Share a Space
To opposing creatures can share a space. While they share a space they both have a Hindrance on Athletics, Weapon and Enigma rolls, except for Weapon rolls with weapons with the Fine tag. As well, both creatures have a Hindrance on React and Deflect defenses. Both creatures are Exposed.

### Adjacent
Creatures who's occupied space touches another creature’s occupied space are considered adjacent.

### Threatened Spaces
The spaces that a creature can reach with a wielded weapon are considered threatened. Moving out of a threatened space will provoke a Movement Response unless the creature makes an Evade Act.

### Expose
Exposing a target makes them vulnerable to exploiting. Some conditions expose a creature to specific attacks. 

#### Flanking
When allied creatures are opposite of each other with the target in the middle, the target is exposed to their flanking attackers.

### Exploit
Some abilities require a target to be exposed to exploit. 

### Actions in combat
#### Act
Acts are the primary actions made in combat. They do the most, hit the hardest, or have the most spectacular effects.

##### Attack
A [[#Character]] makes a [[#Weapons]]+[[#Stats|Stat]] (as appropriate for that weapon) roll against a target's [[#React]] defense. If the [[#Character]] succeeds, the attack connects and it deals damage according to the weapon's features. Some weapons have features that can be used instead of making an attack. Using those features is treated like an attack.

A [[#NPC]] declares their intent to attack a [[#Character]] and the [[#Character]] makes a [[#React]] defense against the attack's [[#Target Number]]. If the [[#Character]] succeeds the attack misses.  

##### Cast a spell
To cast a spell the Player rolls [[#Spellcasting Roll]] against the target's defense listed in the spell. If a creature casts a spell of Tier 1 or higher they can no longer cast a spell as a [[#Swift Act]].

##### Dash
The creature can move up to their speed.

##### Dodge
The creature have Edge on all [[#React]] rolls until their next turn.

##### Grab
The creature makes a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the target's [[#React]] to give the target creature the [[#Grappled]] condition. As an [[#Act]], grappled creature can roll their [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] or [[#Strength]]+[[#Dexterity]] against the grabbing creature's [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] to escape the grab. While holding a grappled enemy the grabbing creature can move at half the creature's speed.

##### Help
While adjacent to a foe threatened by an ally, a creature can help that ally hit easier. The enemy is [[#Expose|Exposed]] until the beginning of the helper's next turn.

##### Hide
While in full cover  a creature makes a [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creatures that cannot see the creature, then moves at least half of their movement they become [[#Hidden]]. Their position not be noticed until the enemy creature makes the [[#Swift Act]] [[#Scan the Battlefield]] or the hidden creature deals damage, casts a spell, or otherwise calls attention to themselves.

##### Shove
A creature makes a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against the [[#Body]] of a target no more than one size category larger to push the target 2 spaces and knock them prone.

##### Evade
The creature doesn't provoke [[#Movement Response]] when moving through spaces.

#### Swift Act
Swift Acts are actions that follow the main action. They could be offhand attacks, abilities, or other actions that don't rise to a full [[#Act]].

##### Offhand Attack
If a creature has a weapon with the [[#Fine]] feature it can be used to make an Offhand Attack.

##### Cast a Spell
If a creature casts a spell with a [[#Swift Act]] casting time, they cannot cast another spell this round, other than a [[#Cantrip]].

##### Scan the Battlefield
A creature makes a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to reveal hidden enemies.

#### Move Act
[[#Creatures]] can move up to their total speed in one round. That movement can be interspersed with other actions as long as the total movement is no more than their movement speed.

##### Rising from Prone
Rising from prone uses half of the creature's speed.

#### Minor Act
Minor Acts are saying a few words, interacting with an object, drawing a weapon, dropping an item in the creature's hand, hand off an item to another willing creature, or other simple activity that doesn't require attention while distracted by combat.

#### Response
Creatures respond to another creature's action during that other creature's turn. A creature has a single response they can take between their turns unless otherwise specified.

##### Movement Response 
When a creature moves out of a [[#Threatened Space]] without making a [[#withdraw]] act, the creature threatening that space can make an melee weapon attack on that creature.

### Defending
When a Character is attacked or otherwise the target of a spell or ability, the Player rolls a [[#d12]] and adds the appropriate [[#Defenses|Defense]] bonus. If the roll exceeds the [[#Target Number]] the attack fails.

When a character attacks the Player's roll has to exceed the the target's [[#Defenses|Defense]].

## Dealing Damage
When dealing damage, the source of the damage has a damage die listed. Roll that and apply the target's [[#Soak]]. Subtract the remaining damage from the target's [[#Temporary HP]] then, if there is any damage remaining, the target's [[#Current HP]]. If the attack deals more damage than the creature has [[#Current HP]], the creature's [[#HP]] becomes 0.

### Critical Success
When a Player roll a 12 on the attack roll and the roll would hit the attack deals maximum damage. If the roll would not hit, the attack deals normal damage. 

### Critical Failure
When a Player rolls a 1 on a defense and the roll does not exceed the [[#Target Number]] their character takes maximum damage from the attack.

### Damage Resistance
If a creature has Damage Resistance they take half damage, rounded down, before applying the creature's [[#Soak]].

### Massive Damage
If a creature takes more than half of their [[#Maximum HP]] in a single attack they need to make a [[#Body]] roll against the total damage taken. Otherwise they drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]]. Creatures that take more than their [[#Maximum HP]] before applying soak drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]].

## Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[#HP]] they fall [[#Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

### Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[#Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, and on a [[#Critical Success]] they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and on a [[#Critical Failure]] they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[#HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[#HP]] stabilizes the creature. Another creature can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical Expertise to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[#Temporary [[#HP]]]] while having 0 [[#HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.

## Healing Damage
During a [[#Short Rest]] a character can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[#Expertise]]) against the creature's current HP to heal a target 1d6 [[#HP]], this can only be done to a target once taking a [[#Long Rest]]. Taking a [[#Long Rest]] heals [[#HP]] equal to the character's [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6, always healing at least one [[#HP]].  Otherwise, a spell or item can be used to heal.

## Conditions
Conditions are temporary effects that change a creature's capabilities. The source of the condition will have rules on how the condition ends. And there are abilities and spells that can end conditions immediately.

### Blinded
The character cannot see and as such have Hindrance on [[#React]] rolls, [[#Deflect]] rolls and [[#Senses]] rolls. Characters have an [[#Edge]] on attack rolls against creatures who are Blinded. Attacks made by a Blinded creatures have a [[#Hindrance]]. [[#Stealth]] rolls have [[#Edge]] against Blinded creatures. Blind creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Bleeding
The creature loses one [[#HP]] at the start of their turn until they are healed at least 1 [[#HP]] or as an [[#Act]] a creature makes an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[#Expertise]]) with a [[#Target number]] of 8.

### Charmed
The charmed creature cannot attack the creature that charmed it. The charmed creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on rolls that use [[#Will]] or their [[#Mind]] defense when interacting with the creature that charmed it. Charmed creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]] to the creature that charmed it.

### Deafened
The character cannot hear and as such have a [[#Hindrance]] on [[#React]] rolls, [[#Social]] rolls, and [[#Senses]] rolls. [[#Stealth]] rolls have [[#Edge]] against deafened creatures. Deafened creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Frightened
The creature cannot move towards the source of their fear. Frightened characters have a [[#Hindrance]] on all rolls while they can sense the source of their fear. Characters that inspire fear have Edge on rolls targeting their [[#Mind]] defense. Frightened creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Grappled
The grappled creature's speed is reduced to 0 and attacks with weapons that don't have the [[#Fine]] tag have a [[#Hindrance]]. Grappled creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Incapacitated
The creature cannot [[#Act]], make a [[#Swift Act]], make a [[#Response]], or move. Incapacitated  creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Paralyzed
A creature is [[#Incapacitated]] and cannot speak. They automatically fail [[#React]] defenses. Melee attacks against the paralyzed creature are a [[#Critical Success]]. Paralyzed creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Petrified
Petrified creatures and their held items are changed to an inanimate substance. They are [[#Paralyzed]], have [[#Damage Resistance]], and are immune to poison, disease, and aging. Poisons and diseases are not neutralized, just suspended. Petrified  creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Prone
Prone creatures can only crawl using two spaces of movement for every space traveled. Standing up spends half their movement speed. The prone creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on attack rolls. Melee attacks against the prone creature have Edge. Prone creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]] to melee attacks.

### Restrained
Restrained creatures total speed becomes 0. The restrained creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on their [[#React]] defense. The restrained creature has a [[#Hindrance]] on all attacks. Restrained creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

### Sickened
Sickened creatures have a [[#Hindrance]] on all [[#d12]] rolls.

### Unconscious
Unconscious creatures are [[#Paralyzed]] and [[#Prone]]. Unconscious creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

## The Scene

The scene encompasses the area the action takes place in, the features of that area, the creatures within the area, and the actions they take.

### Scene Features
Every scene should have features in it that the characters and NPCs can interact with. The action should not take place in a featureless void. Chairs that can be thrown at a foe to Expose them, tables to flip and provide cover, campfires that can be kicked to spread fire, and chandeliers to swing from are features that the Game Master can populate the scene with. Interacting with features should generally be a Swift act or a Minor Act.

### Light and Visibility
Light and what it reveals is an important factor in the battlefield.

#### Cover
If a creature has at least half of their body behind something solid at opaque between them and their attacker they are considered under Cover. Obscuring effects, like dim light, fog, or dense foliage can also provide Cover from creatures more than 5ft away.  Character's have [[#Edge]] on [[#React]] defenses when behind cover, and have [[#Hindrance]] on attacks against creatures who have cover.

#### Full Cover
If a creature is fully obscured from the vision of their attacker either behind something solid and opaque or within darkness they have Full Cover. Attackers still know the creature is there unless the creature becomes [[#Hidden]].

#### Hidden
A creature is hidden if they have moved into full cover and succeeded on [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creature then moved at least half their movement. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position not be noticed until the beginning the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell.

#### Invisible
A creature is invisible if they cannot be seen, either by a spell, ability, or in complete darkness. A creature can estimate where an invisible target is with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll using senses other than sight against the the target's [[#React]]. If the target is moving stealthily they can make an opposing [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll.

Even if the target is located, all attempts to hit the creature have [[#Hindrance]]. Spells do not have line of effect, so the creature cannot be targeted by non-area spells.

#### Light
Each light source casts an aura of bright light of a specific radius and an aura of dim light twice the radius. 

##### Daylight
Daylight is natural light from the sun. Its dim light is still considered daylight.

##### Bright Light

### Terrain
#### Difficult Terrain
Moving through one space of Difficult Terrain requires two spaces of movement.

#### Hazardous Terrain
Hazardous terrain is [[#Difficult Terrain]] that also deals damage when a character begins their turn within the area or and they move through the area.

#### Aquatic Terrain
##### Swimming
Unless a creature has a swim speed they move at half speed. In armor they need to make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll with a [[#Target Number]] of 6 + the armor and shield's [[#Deflection Bonus]]  every round or begin to sink.

##### Holding Breath
A creature makes a [[#Swift Act]] to hold their breath. They can hold it for as many rounds as a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll. If a creature takes damage while holding their breath a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll against the damage taken is required. If the creature fails they begin suffocating.

##### Suffocating

# Adventuring
## Traveling
When traveling between scenes the distance 

### Travel Time
Travel time is the distance that can be traveled on foot in a set time. This includes stopping for rest breaks and not pushing beyond Easy exertion. The time can be cut in a quarter by every creature making a Difficult Fortitude+Athletics roll. Failure of this roll decreases the creature’s Body by 1. At -4 the creature falls unconscious. Recovering this Body damage requires a day without traveling and lacking exertions like combat. 

Creatures with higher speed can cut the travel time by [[Something]].

### Navigating
When navigating between two distant points the party needs to make a [[#Complex Tasks|Complex Task]] with a [[#Target Number]] based on the ease of finding their way efficiently once per long rest. Well-traveled roads are Simple to follow. Trails and side roads are Easy to travel. And moving through terrain without guideposts or developed paths are Difficult.  

The party navigates with a [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll, detect danger with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll, and to maintain speed with a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the [[#Target Number]] to arrive in the expected amount of time. As a [[#Perk]] they either arrive early or have a beneficial encounter as they travel. As a Complication they have a hostile encounter. On failure they get [[#Lost]] and can attempt to navigate again the next day.

#### Lost
Characters who are lost need to make a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to orient themselves.

## Resting
Characters can take either an eight hour [[#Long Rest]] or a one hour [[#Short Rest]].

### Long Rest
Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain their [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[#HP]]. Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour.  Doing actions that take place during a [[#Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.

### Short Rest
Short Rests are an hour of relaxation. Some [[#Features]] and [[#Magic Items]] reset on a Short Rest.

# Advancing characters
As the story progresses the characters improve.

## Tier
There are four tiers of play. It is advised that characters move to a new tier after a handful of adventures. The precise amount of adventures is up to the Game Master.

|Tiers| Proficiency Bonus | Additional Specialties| Recommended Adventures |
|:--:|:--:|:--:| :--: |
| 1 | +1 | 0 | 0-2 |
| 2 | +2 | 1 | 3-6 |
| 3 | +3 | 2 | 7-10 |
| 4 | +4 | 3 | 11+ |

The character's [[#HP]] increases by their class' base [[#HP]] plus their [[#Fortitude]] modifier. You can choose a new [[#Expertise]] either from the list of [[#Expertise|Expertises]], or create your own. 

## Advanced Classes
A character's class provides new [[#Features]] with each tier. If a [[#Features|Feature]] has the same name as one from a previous Tier, replace the old [[#Features|Feature]] with the new [[#Features|Feature]].

# Enigmas
Enigmas are the supernatural forces in the world.

## Casting a Spell
While each enigma manifests a different source of power, the spells they empower all have similar features. The spell name, a tier, the casting time, target, duration, and description. 

### Spellcasting Focus
Spellcasting focuses are specially crafted items that can be used to channel magical energies. Some focuses, like holy symbols, can be mounted on shields or weapons for double the normal cost to purchase one. 

### Spellcasting Bonus
To cast a spell the character needs to make a Spellcasting Bonus. The [[#Target Number]] is both the caster's current [[#Burn]] and the target's defense. If there are multiple targets, the character only rolls once and applies that to all the target's defenses. 

### Spellcasting Roll
To cast a spell the caster rolls a d12 plus their [[#Spellcasting Bonus]]. For the spell to manifest the caster needs to roll over their current [[#Burn]]. As well, all spells unless otherwise stated in the spellcasting [[#Features|Feature]], require at least one free hand to make motions, a [[#Spellcasting Focus]] in the other, and be able to clearly speak the magic words. If any one of these conditions are not met the caster has a [[#Hindrance]] on their Spellcasting Roll. If two or more requirements are missing the spell fails.

### Burn
Burn is the current level of strain that the spellcaster must overcome to cast a spell. After a long rest, their Burn is set to a base value set by the spellcasting [[#Feature]]. If a spell has an effect on a failed roll, that roll still needs to be equal to or greater than the current Burn to successfully cast. If the spell successfully casts, add the spell’s tier to the caster's current Burn. Cantrips do not add to the caster's Burn, but must succeed to manifest.

### Line of Effect
For a spell to succeed the caster must be able to see the target and have an unobstructed line of sight on the target. When targeting an area the caster needs to just needs to have an unobstructed line of sight on the point that the spell manifests around. For spells that have a target larger than possible to have line of sight, Line of Effect is not required.

## Anatomy of a Spell
### Source
Each spellcasting class draws on a source of their power. 

#### Arcane
Arcane magic manipulates the supernatural forces that wend their way through the world.

#### Divine
Divine magic comes from a being of power beyond the mundane world.

#### Primal
Primal magic is the inherent magic of life and nature.

### Cantrip
Cantrips can be cast at any time. Some cantrips scale as the caster advances in the tiers. If so it will be in the description.

### Spell Tier
Spells with a tier can only be cast using a slot of that tier or higher. Some spells can be cast with a higher tier slot and have details of that in their description.

### Casting time
Spells can be cast as an [[#Act]], a [[#Swift Act]], or a [[#Response]] to cast. If a spell is cast as a [[#Swift Act]] the caster cannot use an [[#Act]] to cast a spell, other than a [[#Cantrip]].

### Material Component
Some spells require a material component beyond using a [[#Spellcasting Focus]]. If one is listed it is consumed when the spell completes.

#### Ritual
Spells that have the ritual casting time take 10 minutes for every Tier of the spell to cast. Performing a spell as a Ritual gives an [[#Edge]] on the [[#Spellcasting Roll]].

### Target
The target is the area or creature that the spell effects, the range at which the spell can be cast, and  if it is an attack the defense resisting the spell. The target can choose to fail their defense.

#### Aura
The radius of the spell extends around the caster.

#### Circle
The radius of a spell extends around a point extending the listed distance, the point is within the listed range.

#### Cone
The spell projects outward in a cone from the caster, effecting all creatures in its area.

#### Cube
The spell fills an area where each side is the size listed, effecting all creatures in its area.

#### Line
The spell projects forward in a line from the caster, effecting each creature it intersects with.

#### Melee
The spell is a melee attack against the target's [[#Deflect]] defense.

#### Range
Targets a single creature within range against their listed defense. If no defense is listed it automatically succeeds.

#### Self
The spell effects the caster alone

#### Sphere
The spell manifests around a point to the listed radius, the point is within the listed range.

#### Touch
The spell effects a creature touched by the caster against the listed defense. If there is no defense listed it can only effect willing creatures.

#### Wall
The spell manifests 5ft wide, 10ft tall, and 30ft long unless otherwise stated in the description.

### Duration
This describes how long a spell lasts. If there is no duration it begins and ends instantaneously. Spells end if the caster begins dying regardless of Duration.

#### Concentration
Some spells require ongoing concentration to maintain. A creature can only concentrate on one spell. When a concentrating character takes damage they need to make a [[#Will]]+[[#Focus]] roll against a [[#Target Number]] equal to the damage dealt. If they fail the roll the spell ends.

#### Permanent
Permanent spells have ongoing effects that doesn't end until the caster dispels them or [[#Break Spell]] is cast on them.
