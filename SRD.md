## Game Master
The Game Master facilitates the game, describes the world, controls all other creatures, and is the final arbiter of the rules.

### Creature
Creatures include characters, but the Game Master should avoid controlling characters.

## Dice
This game uses dice to add randomness to the outcome of choices.
### D4
This is commonly used for [[#Fine]] weapons and bonus die added to rolls.
### D6
This is the common damage die.
### D8
This is the advanced damage die.
### D10
This is the heavy damage die.
### D12
This is what you roll to resolve actions.

## Rolls
When you "make a roll" you roll a [[#d12]] and add a bonus. The bonus is the total of the [[#Stat]] being used for the roll, the [[#Skill]] being used for the roll, and any [[#Expertise]] that the [[#Game Master]] agrees applies. Then you compare the roll to the [[#Target Number]], if it is higher the roll succeeds. If the roll is lower or equal to the [[#Target Number]], the roll fails.

### Target Number
The target number is what the player needs to roll for success. Here are some sample target numbers to match the difficulty of the task.

#### Difficulty

| Difficulty | Target Number |
|:--:|:--:|
| Simple | 4 |
| Easy | 6 |
| Difficult | 10 |
| Hard | 12 |
| Improbable | 16 |
|Impossible|24|

### 1's and 12's
Rolling a 1 on the [[#d12]] is an always a fail. Rolling a 1 on a [[#Defenses|Defense]] is a [[#Critical Failure]], unless the roll would hit the target number, then it is just a Failure.

Rolling a 12 on the d12, if the total roll is greater than the [[#Target Number]] it is a [[#Critical Success]]. If the total roll is not greater than the [[#Target Number]] it is a Success.

### Edges and Hinderances
Instead of gaining transient bonuses characters are granted an [[#Edge]] or [[#Hinderance]] on [[#d12]] rolls. Because players roll the dice, if creatures gain Edge or Hinderance the players roll the inverse against their defense or attack.

#### Edge
When a character has Edge they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the highest roll. If a creature has Hinderance on a defense the attacking character has Edge on all rolls against that defense.

#### Hinderance
When a character has Hinderance they roll the [[#d12]] twice and use the lowest roll. If a creature has Edge on an attack or skill the character has Hinderance when rolling their defense.

### Automatic Success
If you have proficiency in a skill you automatically succeed all Simple rolls. If you also have an applicable [[#Expertise]] you automatically succeed at Easy rolls.  

### Bennies
As a [[#Response]] you can spend bennies to reroll a d12. You can have as many bennies as your [[#Proficiency Bonus]]. You gain bennies by expressing your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]] in play. As well, [[#Game Master|Game Masters]] and [[#Player|Players]] (with [[#Game Master]] approval) can give out bennies to a [[#Player]] for exceptional roleplay.  

### Rolling as a Creature
The [[#Game Master]] never rolls, so when a creature would need to roll add 5 to the bonuses and that becomes the [[#Target Number]] to overcome that roll.

### Rolling Other Dice 
If a different die is required other than the [[#d12]] the die will be noted. This is most often done when rolling damage. There may be a bonus that is applied to this one roll and the applicable [[#Stat]] will be noted. 

# Character Creation
The character is the vessel through which the player experiences the game. To create your character you decide on your tropes then choose your ancestry, culture, background, class, and assign your stats. After deriving your [[#Deflect]], [[#HP]], [[#Proficiency Bonus]], [[#Soak]], and [[#Speed]] your character is complete and ready to play.

## Character Tropes
By playing your trope the [[#Game Master]] rewards [[#Bennies]] that can be spent later. If you want to highlight you are playing your trope make an aside comment that you are playing to your [[#Drive]], [[#Bond]], or [[#Flaw]]. 

### Drive
What drives your character? Why do they adventure? Why didn't they just take the same job as a parent and stay near their home? They should be active goals that are not permanently achievable but can be acted on in the moment.

- To protect those who cannot protect themselves.
- To break the bonds of tyranny.
- To live free and experience the world.
- To repay a debt I can never repay.
- To seek wealth and the pleasures it brings.

### Bond
What does your character hew to? Is it a code of ethics? Is it a group? Is it an ideal? This should be something that informs how they react to their own plight and the plight of those around in the face of adversity.

- Faith provides
- Those I meet are friends until proven otherwise
- Knowledge must be preserved above all else.
- I am loyal to those who seek to do share my desire to do great deeds

### Flaw
What undermines your character? Is it your drive taken to extreme? Is it an exception that will have you set aside your bond? Is it a weakness that your character will revert to when pressed? This should be something that can make your character act sub-optimally in the moment, and is the easiest to gain [[#Bennies]] from acting on. As well, overcoming the flaw at great cost to your character is worth gaining [[#Bennies]]. 

- I am a braggart that will bite of more than I can chew.
- I care more for enriching myself than the lives of others.
- In the face of overwhelming odds I will abandon my fellows.
- The pursuit of knowledge blinds me to the plight of others.

## Starting Expertices
An [[#Expertise]] is an aspect of your character that you can call on to improve rolls by adding your proficiency bonus to your rolls. Some are broad, some are very specific.

| Animal | Cost|
|:--|:--:|
|[[#Donkey]]||
|[[#Horse]]||
|[[#Hunting Hawk]]||
| [[#Mastiff]] ||

### Training Pets

Purchased pets are already trained. Training a pet to rely on you takes 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]] days, working 2 hours per day. At the end of each training day roll a [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] vs 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]]. On a failed roll add another day to the training. Between trainings, a [[#Beast]] will follow its master but Hide]] in combat.

### Training Pets for Combat

Training a pet for combat takes time. If purchasing one multiply the cost of the animal by 10. It takes as many weeks as the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]], working 2 hours per day. At the end of each week roll  [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] vs 6 plus the [[#Beast]]’s [[#Challenge]]. On a failed roll add another week to the training. Once trained, the pet can also be commanded to Attack or Help a target as a Swift Act.

# Running the Game

## When to Roll
Something advice on when to roll, reiterate the difficulty table?

### Complex Tasks
Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] check. In this case the [[#Game Master]] decides on three [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls necessary to compete the task. Some of the available [[#Stats|Stat]]+[[#Skills|Skill]] rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest [[#Specialties]] that might apply, but it is up to the [[#Game Master]] to allow it. Three different characters need to complete one of the three checks. Depending on how many succeed determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, as we as if it has bonuses or complications.

* **Three Successes** - succeed with a [[#Perk]].
* **Two Successes** - succeed in the task.
* **One success** - success with a [[#Complication]]
* **No successes** - failing the task

Some examples of complex tasks are:

#### Escaping through a crowd
The party can disappear into a crowd with a shared challenge of spotting pursuers and openings with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll, lead the group from cover to cover with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll or maneuver the crowd between you and the pursuers with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Social]] roll, and to move quickly with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll or move nimbly with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the [[#React]] defense of their pursuers to shake them. As a [[#Perk]] you can maneuver your pursuers to the place of your choosing. On failure the party is tracked and as a [[#Complication]] they run into a different set of enemies.

#### Runaway carriage
The party can stop of a runaway carriage with a shared challenge of taking control of the reins with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] or recover the fallen reins [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Athletics]], maneuver the vehicle [[#Wits]]+[[#Pilot]], control the animals with a [[#Will]]+[[#Social]] with a target number of 10. As [[#Perk]] they bring the carriage under control without stopping. On failure the beasts don't stop until the carriage breaks. As a [[#Complication]] one of the characters is thrown from the carriage. 

#### Tracking a creature. 
The party can track a creature through the wilds with a shared challenge of reading trail signs of the target's passing with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Knowledge]], spot trail signs and movement in the brush with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]], and move on the target without giving yourself away with a [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] or rushing to overtake them with a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against a target number of 6+Creature Tier, unless the creature is moving stealthily then it is 6+ the creature's [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]]. As a [[#Perk]] they are able to catch the creature totally unaware. On a failure the creature slips their grasp and as a [[#Complication]] the target has lured the party into an ambush.


## Combat

### Initiative
All characters roll their [[#React]] defense to determine their initiative score. Creatures initiative score is their [[#React]] defense. Creatures and characters go in order from highest to lowest.

### Turn
On each creature's initiative they can make one [[#Act]], one [[#Swift Act]], and a [[#Minor Action]].

### Expose
Exposing a target makes them vulnerable to exploiting. Some conditions expose a creature to specific attacks. 

#### Flanking
When allied creatures are opposite of each other with the target in the middle, the target is exposed to melee attacks.

### Exploit
Some abilities require a target to be exposed to exploit. 

### Actions in combat
#### Act
Acts are the primary actions made in combat. They do the most, hit the hardest, or have the most spectacular effects.

##### Attack
You make a [[#Weapons]]+[[#Stats|Stat]] (as appropriate for that weapon) roll against a target's [[#React]] defense. If you roll over the [[#React]] defense the attack connects and you deal damage according to the weapon's features. Some weapons have features that can be used instead of making an attack. Using those features is treated like an attack.

##### Cast a spell
To cast a spell you roll Enigmas + Stat (Casting stat for your class) against the target's defense as listed in the spell. If you cast a spell of level 1 or higher you can no longer cast a spell as a Swift Act.

##### Dash
You can move up to your speed.

##### Dodge
You have Edge on all [[#React]] rolls until your next turn.

##### Grab
You make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll to give the target creature the [[#grappled]] condition. A creature can roll their [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] or [[#Strength]]+[[#Dexterity]] against the grabbing creature's [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] to escape the grab.

##### Help
While adjacent to a foe threatened by an ally, you can help that ally hit easier. You grant that ally [[#Edge]] on their next attack and [[#Expose]] the enemy until the beginning of your next turn.

##### Hide
While in full cover and the creature makes a [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creatures then moves at least half of their movement they become [[#Hidden]]. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position not be noticed until the beginning of the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell.

##### Shove
You make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] against the target's [[#Body]] to push the target and knock them prone.

##### Withdraw
The character can make the withdraw action, as such they don't provoke [[#Movement Response]]

#### Swift Act
Swift Acts are actions that follow the main action. They could be offhand attacks, abilities, or other actions that don't rise to a full [[#Act]].

##### Offhand Attack
If you have a weapon with the [[#Fine]] feature it can be used to make an offhand attack.

##### Cast a Spell
If you cast a spell with a [[#Swift Act]] casting time, you cannot cast another spell this round, other than a cantrip.

##### Scan the Battlefield
You make a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to reveal hidden enemies.

#### Move
Characters can move up to their total speed in one round. That movement can be interspersed with other actions as long as the total movement is no more than their movement speed.

##### Rising from Prone
Rising from prone takes half of your speed

#### Minor Action
Minor actions are saying a few words, interacting with an object, drawing a weapon, dropping an item in your hand, hand off an item to another willing creature, or other simple activity that doesn't require attention while distracted by combat.

#### Response
Response actions are done in response to another creature's action during their turn. A creature has a single response they can take between their turns unless otherwise specified.

##### Movement Response 
When a creature moves out of a [[#Threatened Space]] without making a [[#withdraw]] act, you can make an melee weapon attack on that creature.


### Defending
When a Character is attacked or otherwise the target of a spell or ability, the Player rolls a [[#d12]] and adds the appropriate [[#Defenses|Defense]] bonus. If the roll exceeds the [[#Target Number]] the attack fails.

When a character attacks the Player's roll has to exceed the the target's [[#Defenses|Defense]].

## Dealing Damage
When you deal damage the source had a damage die that applies to the target's [[#HP]]. The creature reduces the damage by their [[#Soak]], but never reducing it below one. If the attack deals more damage than the creature has [[#HP]], the creature's [[#HP]] becomes 0.

### Critical Success
When you roll a 12 on the attack roll and the roll would hit you deal maximum damage. If the roll would not hit, you deal normal damage. 

### Critical Failure
When you roll a 1 on a defense and the roll does not exceed the [[#Target Number]] you take maximum damage from the attack.

### Damage Resistance
If you have resistance you take half damage, rounded down, before applying your [[#Soak]].

### Massive Damage
If a creature takes more than half of their total [[#HP]] in a single attack they need to make a [[#Body]] roll against the total damage taken. Otherwise they drop to 0 [[#HP]] and begin [[#Dying]].

### Temporary HP
Temporary HPs are additional beyond the character's [[#HP]]. When a character gains Temporary HPs they replace the current value if the current value is higher. When the character takes damage the Temporary HPs go away first.

## Dying
When a creature reaches 0 [[#HP]] they fall [[#Unconscious]] and begin dying. 

### Stabilization Roll
Every round on a dying creature's turn they make a 1d12 Stabilization roll against a [[#Target Number]] of 6. If they succeed they gain one success, and on a [[#Critical Success]] they gain an additional success. If they fail they gain one failure, and on a [[#Critical Failure]] they gain an additional failure. Taking any amount of damage while Dying gives the creature on failure.  

After three successes they stabilize and cease to be dying at 0 [[#HP]].  After three failures they die. 

Healing at least 1 [[#HP]] stabilizes the creature. Another creature can make an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical Expertise to stabilize a dying creature. Gaining [[#Temporary HP]] while having 0 [[#HP]] does not stabilize a creature, but it does make them conscious.

## Healing Damage
Healing damage requires a creature taking a [[#Short Rest]] and making an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll with any medical Expertise heal 1d6 [[#HP]], this can only be done once before the target takes a [[#Long Rest]]. Taking a [[#Long Rest]] heals [[#HP]] equal to your [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6.  Otherwise, you will need a spell or item to heal.

## Conditions
Conditions are temporary effects that change a creature's capabilities. The source of the condition will have rules on how the condition ends. And there are abilities and spells that can end conditions immediately.

### Blinded

## The Scene

The scene encompasses the area the action takes place in, the features of that area, the creatures within the area, and the actions they take.

### Spacing
For consistencies sake everything is measured in 5ft increments. A medium creature's space is assumed to take up one 5ft square so as not to interfere with each other's actions.

#### Move Through
A creature can move through an allied creature's space. If they end their movement in the same space they are [[#Squeezing]]. Moving through an enemy space, the area is considered [[#Difficult Terrain]]. If a creature ends their turn within another creature's space they are [[#Sharing a Space]] if they are allied, and [[#Sharing a Space]] if they are enemies.

#### Squeeze
Two allied creatures can squeeze into the same space. While they are squeezed together both creatures have Hinderance on [[#Athletics]], [[#Weapon]] and [[#Enigma]] rolls. As well, both creatures have [[#Hinderance]] on [[#React]] and [[#Deflect]] defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

#### Share a Space
To opposing creatures can share a space. While they share a space they both have Hinderance on  [[#Athletics]], [[#Weapon]] and [[#Enigma]] rolls, except for [[#Weapon]] rolls with weapons with the [[#Fine]] tag. As well, both creatures have [[#Hinderance]] on [[#React]] and [[#Deflect]] defenses. Both creatures are [[#Expose|Exposed]].

#### Adjacent
Creatures who's occupied space touches another creatures occupied space are considered adjacent.

#### Threatened Space
Creatures threaten the adjacent spaces surrounding them as long as they have a weapon drawn. Weapons with the [[#Reach]] tag threaten spaces within their listed radius.

### Light and Visibility
Light and what you can reveal with light is an important factor in the battlefield.

#### Cover
If a creature has at least half of their body behind something solid at opaque between them and their attacker they are considered under Cover. Obscuring effects, like dim light, fog, or dense foliage can also provide Cover from creatures more than 5ft away.  Character's have [[#Edge]] on [[#React]] defenses when behind cover, and have [[#Hinderance]] on attacks against creatures who have cover.

#### Full Cover
If a creature is fully obscured from the vision of their attacker either behind something solid and opaque or within darkness they have Full Cover. Attackers still know the creature is there unless the creature becomes [[#Hidden]].

#### Hidden
A creature is hidden if they have moved into full cover and succeeded on [[#Wits]]+[[#Stealth]] check against the enemy creature then moved at least half their movement. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position not be noticed until the beginning the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell.

#### Invisible
A creature is invisible if they cannot be seen, either by a spell, ability, or in complete darkness. A creature can estimate where an invisible target is with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll using senses other than sight against the the target's [[#React]]. If the target is moving stealthily they can make an opposing [[#Dexterity]]+[[#Stealth]] roll.

Even if the target is located, all attempts to hit the creature have [[#Hinderance]]. Spells do not have line of effect, so the creature cannot be targeted by non-area spells.

#### Light Source
Each light source casts an aura of bright light of a specific radius and an aura of dim light twice the radius. Targets in dim light are within [[#Cover]].
* Candle 5ft
* Torch 30ft
* Daylight 60ft (reflected through an opening into an enclosed space)

### Terrain
#### Difficult Terrain
Difficult terrain require two squares of movement to move through each square of difficult terrain.

#### Hazardous Terrain
Hazardous terrain is [[#Difficult Terrain]] that also deals damage when a character begins their turn within the area or every 5ft they move through the area.

#### Terrain Opportunities
Terrain should also include features that creatures can interact with. Chandeliers to swing across, pillars to knock over, chairs to throw into enemy's faces are all things within the battlefield. Interacting with the terrain should be a [[#Swift Act]] so the characters can still do things after they interact.

#### Aquatic Terrain
##### Swimming
Unless a creature has a swim speed they move at half speed. In armor they need to make a [[#Strength]]+[[#Athletics]] roll with a [[#Target Number]] of 6 + the armor and shield's [[#Deflection Bonus]]  every round or begin to sink.

##### Holding Breath
When a creature [[#Act]]s to hold their breath they can hold it for as many rounds as a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll.

If you take damage a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Focus]] roll against the damage taken is required to keep holding your breath. If you fail you begin suffocating.

##### Suffocating
A creature can suffocate for a number of rounds equal to their [[#Fortitude]] bonus. After that they begin making [[#Stabilization Roll]]s at the beginning of their turn as long as it is in the water. After three failures the creature dies.



# Adventuring
## Traveling
When traveling between scenes the distance 

### Travel Time

### Navigating
When navigating between two distant points the party needs to make a [[#Complex Tasks|Complex Task]] with a [[#Target Number]] based on the ease of finding your way efficiently.  They navigate with a [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] roll, detect danger with a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll, and to maintain speed with a [[#Fortitude]]+[[#Athletics]] roll against the [[#Target Number]] to arrive in the expected amount of time. As a [[#Perk]] they either arrive early or have a beneficial encounter as they travel. The have a hostile encounter as a [[#Complication]]. On failure they get [[#Lost]].

#### Lost
Characters who are lost need to make a [[#Wits]]+[[#Senses]] roll to orient themselves.

## Adventures
An adventure is a series of scenes strung together in a single story. [[something]]

## Resting
You can take either an eight hour [[#Long Rest]] or a one hour [[#Short Rest]].

### Long Rest
Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain your [[#Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[#HP]]. Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour. Taking a [[#Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.

### Short Rest
Some classes have abilities that reset on a Short Rest.

# Advancing characters
As the story progresses the characters improve.

## Tier
There are four tiers of play. It is advised that you move to a new tier after a handful of adventures. The precise amount of adventures is up to your Game Master.

|Tiers| Proficiency Bonus | Additional Specialties| Recommended Adventures |
|:--:|:--:|:--:| :--: |
| 1 | +1 | 0 | 0-2 |
| 2 | +2 | 1 | 3-6 |
| 3 | +3 | 2 | 7-10 |
| 4 | +4 | 3 | 11+ |

Your HP increases by your class's base HP plus your [[#Fortitude]] modifier. You can choose a new [[#Expertise]] either from the list of Expertises, or create your own. 

Your class also provides abilities with each tier.

## Expertise

You can apply a Expertise to rolls within their field of expertise, adding your proficiency to the roll. You can only add once Expertise to any one roll. You do not need to be proficient in a skill to use a Expertise.

# Enigmas
Enigmas are the supernatural forces in the world.

## Casting a Spell
While each enigma manifests a different source of power, the spells they empower all have similar features. The spell name, a tier, the casting time, target, duration, and description. 

To cast a spell the character needs to make a roll of the [[#Archetypes|Archetype]]'s Spellcasting Ability + [[#Enigma]]. The [[#Target number]] is both the caster's current [[#Burn]] and the target's defense. If there are multiple targets, the character only rolls once and applies that to all the target's defenses. 

All spells require at least one free hand to make motions, a focus item in the other, and speak the magic words. If any of these conditions are not met you have Hinderance on your Spellcasting Ability + [[#Enigma]] roll. 

### Burn
Burn is the current level of strain that the spellcaster must overcome to cast a spell. After a long rest, their Burn is set to a base value. For the spell to manifest you need to roll over your current Burn to the target’s defense, whichever is higher. If a spell has an effect on a failed roll, that roll still needs to be above the current burn to have an effect. If you succeed or fail, add that spell’s tier to your current Burn. Cantrips do not add to your Burn.

## Anatomy of a Spell
### Source
Each spellcasting class draws on a source of their power. 
#### Arcane
Arcane magic manipulates the supernatural forces that wend their way through the world.
#### Divine
Divine magic comes from a being of power beyond the mundane world.
#### Primal
Primal magic is the inherent magic of life and nature.

### Cantrip
Cantrips can be cast at any time. Some cantrips scale as you advance in the tiers. If so it will be in the description.


### Spell Tier
Spells with a tier can only be cast using a slot of that tier or higher. Some spells can be cast with a higher tier slot and have details of that in their description.

### Casting time
Spells can be cast as an [[#Act]], a [[#Swift Act]], or a [[#Response]] to cast. If you cast a spell as a [[#Swift Act]] you cannot use an [[#Act]] to cast a spell, other than a [[#Cantrip]].

### Material Component
Some spells require a material component beyond using your focus item. If one is listed it is consumed when the spell is successfully cast.

#### Ritual
Spells that have the ritual casting time take 10 minutes to cast. Performing a spell as a ritual gives an [[#Edge]] on the spellcasting roll.

### Target
The target is the area or creature that the spell effects, the range at which the spell can be cast, and  if it is an attack the defense resisting the spell. The target can choose to fail their defense.

#### Aura
The radius of the spell extends around the caster.

#### Circle
The radius of a spell extends around a point extending the listed distance, the point is within the listed range.

#### Cone
The spell projects outward in a cone from the caster, effecting all creatures in its area.

#### Cube
The spell fills an area where each side is the size listed, effecting all creatures in its area.

#### Line
The spell projects forward in a line from the caster, effecting each creature it intersects with.

#### Melee
The spell is a melee attack against the target's [[#Deflect]] defense.

#### Range
Targets a single creature within range against their listed defense. If no defense is listed it automatically succeeds.

#### Self
The spell effects the caster alone

#### Sphere
The spell manifests around a point to the listed radius, the point is within the listed range.

#### Touch
The spell effects a creature touched by the caster against the listed defense. If there is no defense listed it can only effect willing creatures.

#### Wall
The spell manifests 5ft wide, 10ft tall, and 30ft long unless otherwise stated in the description.

### Duration
This describes how long a spell lasts. If there is no duration it begins and ends instantaneously.

#### Concentration
Some spells require ongoing concentration to maintain. A creature can only concentrate on one spell. When a concentrating character takes damage they need to make a [[#Will]]+[[#Focus]] roll against a [[#Target number]] equal to the damage dealt. If they fail the roll the spell ends.
