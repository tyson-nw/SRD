Enigmas are the supernatural forces in the world. The powers of creation that give shape to reality, the divine forces who mold that reality, and the arcane energies that flow through reality.

## Casting a Spell
While each enigma manifests a different source of power, the spells they empower all have similar components. The spell name, a tier, the casting time, target, duration, and description. 

### [[Foci]]
