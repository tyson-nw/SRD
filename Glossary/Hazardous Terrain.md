Hazardous terrain is [[Difficult Terrain]] that also deals damage when a character begins their turn within the area or and they move through the area. Steam vents, vicious brambles, or spinning blades are all Hazardous Terrain. The Hazardous Terrain may have a [[Target Number]] to avoid the damage with your [[React]] defense. Hazardous Terrain effects a creature as they move through it.
