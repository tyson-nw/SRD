Objects have durability. It is a score that is applied to damage before soak and it can reduce the damage to 0. The score is set by the [[Difficulty]] of damaging the object. So [[Hard]] to damage items have a Durability of 14, [[Easy]] to break items have a Durability of 6. Unless they are built to resist damage they have a [[Soak]] of 0 an [[HP]] of 1. Dealing enough damage to surpass the targetâ€™s Durability always adds a [[Complication]].
