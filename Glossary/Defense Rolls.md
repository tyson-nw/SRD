The defending character rolls the appropriate defense against the [[Target Number]] of an enemy action.
- If the roll is a 12 on the die, the defense succeeds with a [[Defense Perk]] as long as the roll is greater than the [[Target Number]]. Otherwise it just succeeds.
- If the roll is greater than the [[Target Number]] the defense succeeds.
- If the roll is less than the [[Target Number]], the defense fails.
- If the roll is a one on the die, the defense fails. If the roll total is also below the [[Target Number]]  it adds a [[Defense Complication]]
