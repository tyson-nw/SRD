A character can attempt to become hidden by making a [[Wits]]+[[Stealth]] check while in [[Full Cover]] from their potential observers. The Gamemaster compares the result against the [[Mind]] defense of any actual observers. If the character is successful, the observers lose track of the characterâ€™s position. If the hidden character deals damage, casts a spell, or otherwise calls attention to themselves, they will be revealed. Their position won't be noticed until the enemy creature makes a [[Maneuver]] to [[Scan the Battlefield]] or the hidden creature reveals themself.
