To cast a spell the caster rolls a d12 plus their [[Spellcasting Bonus]]. For the spell to manifest the caster needs to roll over their current [[Burn]]. As well, all spells unless otherwise stated in the spellcasting [[Features|Feature]], require at least one free hand to make motions, a [[Foci]] in the other, and be able to clearly speak the magic words. If any one of these conditions are not met the caster has a [[Hindrance]] on their Spellcasting Roll. If two or more requirements are missing the spell fails.
