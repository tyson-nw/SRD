Long rests are an 8 hour period of rest and relaxation where creatures don't take strenuous actions. As a part of the long rest spellcasters can prepare spells. After the Long Rest characters regain their [[Body]] modifier + 1d6 [[HP]] times their Tier.  Some items have abilities or charges that refresh on a Long Rest. Strenuous activity that interrupts the long rest extends the period required to complete a long rest by an hour.  Doing actions that take place during a [[Short Rest]] once during the long rest does not count as a strenuous action.
