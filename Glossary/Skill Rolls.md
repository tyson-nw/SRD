- If you roll 12 on the die you succeed with a [[Perk]] as long as the total roll is equal to or greater than the Target Number. If you roll a 12 but the total roll is under the [[Target Number]] it succeeds normally. 
- If you roll a 1 on the die and the total of the die and the bonus is less than the [[Target Number]] you fail with a [[Complication]].
- If the roll is anything but a 1 or 12 and total of the die plus the bonus is equal to or greater than the [[Target Number]] the roll succeeds. 
- If the total of the roll is below the [[Target Number]] you succeed with a [[Complication]].
