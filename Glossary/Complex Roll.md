Some tasks are not achievable by a single character using a single [[Stat]]+[[Skills|Skill]] roll. In this case, the Game Master decides on three [[Stat]]+[[Skills|Skill]] rolls necessary to complete the task, and asks they players to decide which characters will make the roll. Some of the available [[Stat]]+[[Skills|Skill]] rolls may have alternative rolls the player can make. And the players can always suggest adding an [[Expertise]] that might apply, but it is up to the Game Master to allow it. Three different characters need to complete each of the three checks. If there are not enough characters to make all three checks, a character can make a second check at a [[Hindrance]].  A character that has the required [[Skills|Skill]] can assist another character who is rolling, granting the rolling character an [[Edge]] on their roll. The number of checks that succeed determines if the overall task succeeds or fails, as well as whether [[Perk|Perks]] or [[Complication|Complications]] applies.

- **Three Successes** - succeeds with a [[Perk]].
- **Two Successes** - succeed the task.
- **One Success** - succeeds the task with a [[Complication]]
- **No Successes** - fails the task with a [[Complication]]
