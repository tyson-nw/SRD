Skill perks are things that push the plot forward more than just a success. Each will be individual to the particular roll you are making. When making a [[Social]] roll against a target [[NPC]] the target may become more friendly and willing to assist the characters. When making an [[Athletics]] roll the character performs above and beyond the intended goal. When looking for information the character can find details above and beyond what would have been found with just a success. The Perk doesn't have to be directly related to the action that provided it, but anything that will push forward the story. Some skills have default perks and some weapons, features, and spells have their own optional [[Perk|Perks]]. A [[Player]] can choose only one [[Perk]] to apply to a [[Rolls|Roll]]

##### Enigma Perk
Recover [[Burn]] equal to the [[Enigmas#Spell Tier|Spell Tier]] of the spell.

##### Weapon Perk
If making a weapon roll, choose from the weapon's tags the perk to apply to the [[Action]].
