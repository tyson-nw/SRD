Blight effects a single [[Stat]] for a number of levels. For [[Character|Characters]],  [[Skill Rolls]] and [[Defense Rolls]] that include the Blighted [[Stat]] subtract a [[D4]] from that roll for each level of Blight. For [[NPC|NPCs]], every time a [[Character]] rolls against the Blighted [[Stat]], add a [[D4]] to the character's roll. One level of Blight from each blighted stat is healed by a [[Recovery Rest]]. A creature can only have as much blight in one [[Stat]] as 1 plus their [[Fortitude]] [[Stat]]. If they gain more, they become [[Incapacitated]].
