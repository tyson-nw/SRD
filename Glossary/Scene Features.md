Every scene should have Scene Features in it that the [[Character|Characters]] and [[NPC|NPCs]] can interact with. The action should not take place in a featureless void. Chairs that can be thrown at a foe to [[Expose]] them, tables to flip and provide cover, campfires that can be kicked to spread fire, and chandeliers to swing from are Scene Features that the [[Game Master]] can populate the scene with. Interacting with Scene Features should generally be a [[Maneuver]] or an [[Interaction]].
