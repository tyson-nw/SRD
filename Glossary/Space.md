Spaces are an abstraction of space for the creatures to move through. This assumes that play takes place on a battle map with a grid of some sort. They are either 5ft space or 2 meters depending on your Game Masterâ€™s preference. The space is not only the area the creature takes up, but also the area needed to take actions without interference. [[Tiny]] creatures exist in a space, but do not take up a space. [[Small]] and [[Medium]] creatures take up a single Space. [[Large]] creatures take up a two-by-two square of spaces. [[Huge]] creatures take up a four-by-four square of spaces. [[Colossal]] creatures take up more spaces than can easily be represented on a battlefield.
