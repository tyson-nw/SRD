The creature loses one [[HP]] at the start of their turn until they are healed at least 1 [[HP]]. Bleeding can be applied multiple times, the damage increases by 1 each time. As an [[Action]] a creature can stop a target from Bleeding with an [[Easy]] + Level of Bleeding [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll (applying any medical [[Expertise]]). If the creature is at 0 HP they no longer have the bleeding condition but are dying as normal.
