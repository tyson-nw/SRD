#### Terrain Hazards
When in a chase, Terrain Hazards are things that interfere with the chase. Participants must use their  [[Maneuver]] the to make a [[Wits]]+[[Pilot]] roll greater than the terrainâ€™s difficulty. They crash if they fail their roll reducing their speed to 0 and take 1d6 damage for every 2 spaces of speed beyond 6 they were traveling at.

- **Crowds** - Non-participants that are in the way to that will stop the participant at slow speeds or will take damage at high speeds. 
- **Buildings** - Tight corridors or buildings make for navigational hazards. Typically failing a [[Pilot]] roll will stop a participant and they will take damage.
- **Debris** - There are debris on the participants path that will do damage to the participants or their vehicles.
