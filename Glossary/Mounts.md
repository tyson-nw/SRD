Mounts, by default, attempt to use their [[Action]] to [[Dodge]] if they don't move, or [[Evade]] if they do. Commanding a mount to do anything else requires a [[Maneuver]]. If the commanded [[Action]] is [[Easy]] such as moving, dodging, or attacking if battle trained commanding does not require a roll to command. But if the [[Action]] is more complex or requires the mount to make a roll, like jumping a gap, using a terrain feature, or other action then the rider must make a [[Will]]+[[Pilot]] [[Rolls|Roll]]. The [[Target Number]] of the command is the same as the [[Target Number]] for the commanded [[Action]]. The rider [[Rolls]] for their mount.
