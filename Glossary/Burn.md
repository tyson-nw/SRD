Burn is the current level of strain that the creature must overcome to cast a spell or activate a feature. After a long rest, their Burn is set to a base value set by the spellcasting [[Features|Feature]]. If a spell has an effect on a failed roll, that roll still needs to be equal to or greater than the current Burn to successfully cast. If the spell successfully casts, add the spellâ€™s tier to the caster's current Burn. As a [[Complication]] add the spell's tier to the caster's current Burn. Cantrips do not add to the caster's Burn, but the [[Spellcasting Roll]] must be equal to or greater than the current Burn to manifest.
