A creature is hidden if they have moved into full cover and succeeded on [[Wits]]+[[Stealth]] check against the enemies [[React]] then moved at least half their movement. The hidden creature can move out of Full Cover and their position will not be noticed until the beginning the enemy creature's turn, or until the hidden creature deals damage or casts a spell. Creatures that do not see a hidden creature are [[Expose|Exposed]] to the hidden creature.
