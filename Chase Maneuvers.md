#### Chase Maneuvers
When in a chase there are [[Maneuver|Maneuvers]] that a vehicle or mount pilot can take. Each one causes passengers to have a [[Hindrance]] on [[Skill Rolls]] unless stated otherwise. It is possible to have a chase involving creatures not mounted or piloting vehicles. In this case, roll [[Athletics]] instead of [[Pilot]] to perform Chase Maneuvers.

##### Accelerate
Accelerate allows the participant to increase speed. That increase maxes out at twice the movement speed of the participant. At every space beyond their base speed they accelerate, the [[Target Number]] for their [[Pilot]] rolls increase by 1. As well, the damage that a complication can do increases by 1 die for every four spaces of increased speed.

##### Disappear
When traveling through terrain that can screen the participant they try and use the terrain to [[Hide]] from their pursuers. The [[Wits]]+[[Pilot]] roll is against the pursuer’s [[Mind]]. It costs the participant at least half of their current speed, if not all. If passengers roll against the pursuers they become aware of the disappeared participant.

##### Elude
The pilot attempts to make the mount or vehicle harder to hit. Making a [[Moderate]] [[Wits]]+[[Pilot]] [[Rolls|Roll]] grants the vehicle and passengers [[Edge]] on [[Deflect]] and [[React]] [[Defenses]].

##### Hold Steady
The pilot directs the mount or vehicle to maintain course with minimal disturbance. If passing through [[Difficult Terrain]] they must make a [[Pilot]]+[[Wits]] roll against the [[Target Number]] of the terrain to maintain their speed and avoid any potential [[Terrain Hazards]]. Passengers do not gain a [[Hindrance]] from this [[Maneuver]].

##### Juke
The pilot attempts to direct another chase participant into [[Terrain Hazards]].

##### Swap
The pilot attempts to get behind a participant that is behind them. They must make a [[Wits]]+[[Pilot]] roll against the target’s [[Mind]] defense. If they succeed they can slow their speed and change their distance from each other based on how much of a change they made.
