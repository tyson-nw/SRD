## Pets
Pets act on their master’s turn and are trained to [[Evade]] when moving where directed, [[Hide]], or [[Dodge]] in combat. Commanding a pet is a [[Maneuver]]. If attacked, and not given instructions otherwise, the pet will attack its attacker.

| Animal           | Cost |
| :--------------- | :--: |
| [[Donkey]]       |  75  |
| [[Horse]]        | 300  |
| [[Hunting Hawk]] | 400  |
| [[Mastiff]]      | 200  |

### Training Pets

Purchased pets are already trained. Training a pet to rely on a character takes the [[Beast]]’s [[Challenge]] worth of [[Downtime]]. At the end of each training day roll a [[Will]]+[[Social]] vs 6 plus the [[Beast]]’s [[Challenge]]. On a failed roll the training for that week has to be repeated. Between trainings, a [[Beast]] will follow its master but [[Hide]] in combat.

### Training Pets for Combat

Training a pet for combat takes time. If purchasing one multiply the cost of the animal by 10. Once the pet is trained, it can be trained for combat. Training for combat takes as twice the [[Beast]]’s [[Challenge]] worth of [[Downtime]]. At the end of each week roll  [[Will]]+[[Social]] vs 6 plus the [[Beast]]’s [[Challenge]]. On a failed roll the training for that week has to be repeated.. Once trained, the pet can also be commanded to Attack or Help a target as a [[Maneuver]].
