## Rolls
When you "make a roll" you roll a [[D12]] and add a bonus. The bonus is the sum of the [[Stat]] used for the roll, the [[Skills|Skill]] being used for the roll, and any [[Expertise]] that the [[Game Master]] agrees applies to the roll. Then you compare the total roll to the [[Target Number]].

### Edges and Hindrances
Instead of gaining temporary bonuses, characters are granted an [[Edge]] or [[Hindrance]] on [[D12]] rolls. Because players roll the dice, if [[NPC|NPCs]] gain [[Edge]] or [[Hindrance]] the players roll the inverse against their defense or attack. No matter how many ways the character gains an [[Edge]] or a [[Hindrance]], they only roll one additional time. If the character has at least one an [[Edge]] and a [[Hindrance]] they cancel out and the character rolls.

### Rolling as a NPC
The [[Game Master]] never rolls a [[D12]], so when an NPC would need to roll, instead determine the [[Target Number]] by adding 5 to any bonuses the NPC has. Then the Player makes their [[Defense Rolls|Defense Roll]] against that [[Target Number]].

### Rolling Other Dice 
If a different die is required other than the [[D12]] the die will be noted. This is most often done when rolling damage bonuses, or penalties to [[Rolls]]. There may be a bonus that is applied to this roll and the applicable [[Stat]] will be noted.
