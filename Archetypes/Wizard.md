Wizards are masters of the arcane. Their favored stats are [[#Aptitude]] and [[#Will]]. They are proficient in [[#Enigma]] (Arcane), [[#Focus]], [[#Knowledge]], and one additional skill. Wizards have a base HP of 6. Wizards begin with a weapon with the [[#Simple]] tag, and an arcane focus or spell component pouch.

# Tier 1
## Arcane Mastery
Wizards use spellbooks to store their spells. Their [[#Spellcasting Stat]] is [[#Aptitude]]. After each [[#Long Rest]] they decide what spells to prepare for the following day, up to their [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] bonus. Wearing armor casting causes [[#Hinderance]] on [[#Enigma]] rolls. They have a starting [[#Burn]] of 6 that resets after a Long Rest.

## Ritual Cast
The wizard can cast any spell from their spellbook as a [[#Ritual]].

## Spellbook
The wizard records all the spells they know in their spellbook.  They start with  two [[#Cantrips]] and as many Tier 1 spells as their [[#Aptitude]]. They can scribe a new spell from a scroll or other spellbook into their spellbook with an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Enigma]] roll. Scribing takes one hour per [[#Spell Tier]]. The spell takes up two pages per [[#Spell Tier]] of the spell in the spellbook. And if you fail the roll, that many pages of the spellbook are ruined.
