Wizards are masters of the arcane. Their favored stats are [[#Aptitude]] and [[#Will]]. They are proficient in [[#Arcane]] [[#Enigmas]], [[#Focus]], [[#Knowledge]], and one additional skill. Wizards have a base [[#HP]] of 6. Wizards begin with a weapon with the [[#Simple]] tag, and an arcane focus or spell component pouch.

# Tier 1
## Arcane Initiate
Wizards channel the arcane energies that flow through the world. They [[#Spellcasting Bonus]] is their [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Enigmas]] and they use an Arcane Focus or Spell Component Pouch as their [[#Spellcasting Focus]]. After each [[#Long Rest]] they decide what spells to prepare for the following day, up to their [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Knowledge]] bonus and two [[#Cantrip|Cantrips]]. Wearing armor casting causes [[#Hindrance]] on [[#Enigma]] rolls. They have a starting [[#Burn]] of 6 that resets after a Long Rest.

## Ritual Cast
The wizard can cast any spell from their spellbook as a [[#Ritual]].

## Spellbook
The Wizard records all the spells they know in their spellbook.  They start with two [[#Cantrips]] and as many Tier 1 spells as their [[#Aptitude]]. They can scribe a new spell from a scroll or other spellbook into their spellbook with an [[#Aptitude]]+[[#Enigma]] roll. Scribing takes one hour per [[#Spell Tier]]. The spell takes up two pages per [[#Spell Tier]] of the spell in the spellbook. And if you fail the roll, that many pages of the spellbook are ruined.
