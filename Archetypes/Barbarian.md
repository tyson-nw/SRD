They begin with a [[#Martial]] weapon and two [[#Thrown]] weapons.

# Tier 1

## Rage
Barbarians can fly into a rage with [[#Bonus Action]] by making an Easy (Target Number 6) [[#Will]]+[[#Focus]] roll. At the beginning of each subsequent round the barbarian rolls again to continue the Rage, increasing the [[#Target Number]] by two. (If they took damage last round they have advantage on the roll). The Rage lasts until they fail their roll, they do not roll against an enemy's defense by the end of their turn, or decide to end their rage. While in a Rage the Barbarian adds their [[#Will]] to damage, has [[#Damage Resistance]], automatically succeeds on Massive Damage]] rolls, and does not go [[#Unconscious]] when reduced to 0 [[#HP]] but are [[#Dying]].
