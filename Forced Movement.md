A creature can be forced to move by a controlling creature. Forced movement can trigger a [[Movement Response]]. Moving over [[Difficult Terrain]] requires spending two spaces of movement for each space moved as normal. When moving through [[Hazardous Terrain]] the moved creature is affected as if they moved themselves.
