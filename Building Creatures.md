## Creating an Encounter.
To determine what is an appropriate encounter, total the tiers of the characters present. Add the [[Target Number]] of the desired difficulty and subtract 6 for Tier 1 characters, 4 for Tier 2 characters, 2 for Tier 2 characters. That is your encounter budget. Add creatures to the encounter until their total [[Challenge]] equals your encounter budget.
