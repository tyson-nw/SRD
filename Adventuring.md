## Traveling
When traveling between scenes the distance is abstracted. Traveling should include one or more points of interest en-route. The points of interest could be an encounter with hostile [[NPC|NPCs]], an encounter with an [[NPC]] that provides an opportunity, or a fantastical location that adds to the story.

### Travel Time
Travel time is the distance that can be traveled on foot in a set time. This includes stopping for rest breaks and not pushing beyond Easy exertion. The time can be cut in half by every creature making a [[Moderate]] [[Fortitude]]+[[Athletics]] roll. Failure of this roll [[Blighted|Blights]] the creature’s [[Fortitude]] by 1. 

### Navigating
When navigating between two distant points the party needs to make a [[Complex Roll]] with a [[Target Number]] based on the ease of finding their way efficiently once per long rest. Well-traveled roads are [[Simple]] to follow. Trails and side roads are [[Moderate]] to travel. And moving through terrain without guideposts or developed paths is [[Hard]].  

The party navigates with a [[Aptitude]]+[[Knowledge]] roll, detect danger with a [[Wits]]+[[Senses]] roll, and to maintain speed with a [[Fortitude]]+[[Athletics]] roll against the [[Target Number]] to arrive in the expected amount of time. As a [[Perk]] they either arrive early or have a beneficial encounter as they travel. As a Complication they have a hostile encounter. On failure they get [[Lost]] and can attempt to navigate again the next day.

## Tailoring the Adventure to the Tier
As the characters progress in tiers the focus of their adventures should shift. Tier 1 characters are focused on problems of a small location and its foibles. As the characters gain in tiers, so should the threats they face and the reach of the consequences of their actions.

At Tier 2, they have graduated from local concerns to those that threaten a region and have a limited reputation. The plots are more involved, with the characters' actions creating ripples in the local community.

At Tier 3, the threats they face affect multiple regions, possibly the fate of multiple kingdoms. The characters are now well known, and NPCs vie for their assistance in their plots. Hints of larger machinations beyond those of mortal ken should make themselves known.

At Tier 4, worlds hang in the balance. The petty squabbles of lower tiers pale in comparison to the larger machinations of creation that set the stage for lower conflicts. The cosmic forces vie for the character’s allegiances.

## Adventure Rewards
Adventures should provide rewards that drive the characters to continue to adventure. As characters move through adventures they will be rewarded with increasing Tiers, that is the assumed reward. Adventure rewards should come from players taking risks, being curious, and driving the story forward. they should include opportunities for all the characters to gain some sort of reward that is tailored to them.

### Coin
Coin is the simplest form of reward, but it is also the least effective. Other than providing a more comfortable lifestyle for the character, are not many outlets for Coin unless the [[Game Master]] provides opportunities for spending it. Estates, Hirelings, mission-specific equipment, and other things are opportunities for spending Coin that the [[Game Master]] can provide.

### Magic Items
Magic items are the easiest way to provide characters new [[Features]]. It is not advised that the characters can just buy magic items in shops. But, being rewarded with information on where the items they desire can be located, quest givers who will give the item in exchange for a job, or master crafters who could build the desired consumable item are all good avenues for getting characters items their [[Player]] wants.

### Boons
Boons are supernatural rewards that gives the character an [[Edge]] in a specific situation. This could be when negotiating with the Fae, or when fighting a certain [[NPC]], or when attempting a specific task. They should be of limited scope but come up with some regularity.

### Expertise Rewards
[[Expertise|Expertises]] given as a reward should be of very limited scope and reflect the adventure in which they earned. They could be [[Expertise]] in the traps they overcame, the architecture of the scenes, the history of the area, or other aspect of the adventure.

### Titles and Appellations
Titles and appellations are always good rewards. As the [[Character|Characters]] become known they can gain titles that can give them an [[Edge]] in certain situations or be used as an [[Expertise]]. Some titles may have situational [[Hindrance]]. They can be lost due to the character's actions at the Game Master's discretion. Titles can be sacrificed when roleplaying to automatically succeed with a [[Perk]] an [[Improbable]] [[Target Number]].
- They do a great service to a noble and become “Errants”, they now have an [[Edge]] when dealing in that noble’s court. 
- They pull off a job for the thieves guild and become “Crows”, they now get better deals when they hock their treasures.
- They uncover an artifact or secret of great power and become "Seekers", Sages will now do research on their behalf in exchange for details on their adventures.

### Advancing the Character’s Drive
Finally, the opportunity to express the character’s drive and advance it. This is the hardest to achieve, but it is the one that tends to engage the players the most.
